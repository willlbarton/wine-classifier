87131,US,"Very good Dry Creek Zin, robust and dry and spicy. Really gets the tastebuds watering, with its tart flavors of sour cherry candy, red currants, blueberries, tart raisins and oodles of peppery spices. Drink this lusty wine with barbecue.",89,25.0,Zinfandel
57952,France,"A very herbaceous character makes this wine seem rather thin. It's soft and lightweight, and the lemon zest character is mildly attractive. Ready to drink.",84,20.0,Bordeaux-style White Blend
96046,US,"A little simple and easy, but there's a wealth of raspberry, strawberry and floral notes in this delicate wine. It's a bit too sweet for my tastes, although it does have good acidity.",84,19.0,Rosé
31920,US,"From a dry-farmed vineyard and treated to wild yeast and minimal new French oak, this Petite is chewy in leathery tannins, a definite crowd pleaser for Petite fans. Blackberries, coffee and pepper commingle impressively.",88,38.0,Petite Sirah
6091,US,"From a site near Annapolis, this wine shows a preponderance of dark grape and cherry flavor interwoven with cinnamon and black peppercorn. Light-bodied and ethereally layered, it has touches of rustic earthiness and leather.",91,62.0,Pinot Noir
101129,US,"A mix of Cabernet, Cab Franc and Syrah, this out-of-the-ordinary blend is a little funky and meaty, but still offers lots of juicy black fruit and a whole lot of toasted oak. If any one thing announces itself here it's the wood, which keeps everything austere and maybe a touch overcharred.",89,42.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
53584,Italy,"Taurasi is a wine that flaunts a determined and powerful personality, and Fatica Contadina is no exception, thanks to its deep layers of spice, dark fruit, tobacco and cigar that it delivers to the senses. On the palate, it is austere and tightly structured.",89,32.0,Aglianico
61538,US,"Sourced entirely from Walla Walla's Les Collines Vineyard, this lovely Syrah features pretty strawberry and cherry flavors that are broadly displayed with a rich vein of chocolate. It's forward and flavorful, drinking quite nicely already, but with the stuffing to cellar for a few more years.",90,40.0,Syrah
61984,US,"There's a lot to like about this Viognier. It's dry and zesty in acidity, with complex flavors of citrus, peach, kumquat, white pepper, chamomile and honey.",90,20.0,Viognier
16517,US,"A crisp, refreshing Sauvignon Blanc, fermented and aged in stainless steel. Shows rich, savory citrus and green grass flavors, with hints of minerals and flowers. Very drinkable and bone-dry.",90,21.0,Sauvignon Blanc
24901,US,"This proprietary bottling from Shafer is always a huge wine. The 2010, which contains a splash of Petite Verdot, is gigantically packed with blackberry jam, black currant, dark chocolate and sweet oak, courtesy of 20 months in 100% new French oak barrels. The wine is a bit of a bully now, but it has the balance to age. Give it until 2018.",92,72.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
62631,Italy,"Made with organically farmed fruit, this blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Colorino opens with an inky, dark color and savory aromas of ripe fruit, prune, plum, leather, tobacco and exotic spice. It's firm and well structured, with a velvety feel to the tannins.",89,35.0,Red Blend
2544,Italy,"Aromas of blue flower, black-skinned fruit and a whiff of Mediterranean scrub meld in the glass. The chewy, straightforward palate doles out juicy black cherry and ground pepper. It's made to drink young so enjoy soon.",89,22.0,Nero d'Avola
67123,Italy,"Bright, clean and linear with pretty accents of spice, blackberry, leather and lingering tobacco, Villa al Cortile Riserva is the kind of wine you'll want to pair with a hearty meat dinner. The wine shows velvety, soft texture in the mouth.",91,60.0,Sangiovese Grosso
28494,US,"Though labeled simply Columbia Valley, the grapes are single vineyard, Rattlesnake Hills AVA fruit. The best of the Girly Girl lineup, though the promising beginning (cassis and berry, scented with black olive and herb) quickly fades into a forest floor finale of decaying leaves.",85,19.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
34039,US,"The 2009 vintage blend is 41% Marsanne, 42% Grenache Blanc, 10% Picpoul and 7% Roussanne. Complex, rich and dense, it wraps its stone and tropical fruit flavors in layers of caramel, nougat, marshmallow and spice. Still quite young, with plenty of years of life ahead.",92,25.0,White Blend
52991,Italy,"A blend of Nero d'Avola, Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, Campobello's entry-level red is slightly muddled, but it does a good job of offering genuine fruit flavors and overall freshness.",86,17.0,Red Blend
4313,US,"This unusual wine displays notes of cigar box, strong green herbs and woodspice. It drinks on the lighter side of medium bodied with coffee and nori flavors and a smoke-filled finish.",82,22.0,Tempranillo
23629,US,"A bit rough in texture, but otherwise pretty flavorful, with vanilla, lime, strawberry and yeast flavors. It's a great sparkling wine for everyday.",87,30.0,Sparkling Blend
80022,France,"It's not a bad name for this vineyard—Charmes. This wine, which expresses the nature of the vineyard, is certainly approachable, friendly almost. But there's also a steel fist there that demands time. And if you can't wait, it's a great wine to drink now.",93,92.0,Chardonnay
40101,US,"Like a photocopy of a photocopy, this thinned-down Pinot Noir contains only a suggestion of the real thing. It's dry, but watery in cherry-cola flavors.",82,12.0,Pinot Noir
71780,US,"Spicy and dry, this Zin offers flavors of currants, tobacco, pepper and cocoa. The tannins are thick, but acidity is low, giving it a soft mouthfeel. Could be more concentrated, but it's an elegant wine.",87,36.0,Zinfandel
23503,US,"Fresh ripe raspberry aromas are cut with cranberry-skin tartness in this wine by Josh Baker and Matt Brain. They have also managed to sneak blood, pencil shavings, eucalyptus and vanilla stick into the nose of this appellation blend. It's lively and tasty with ripe, tart red fruits once sipped, juicy yet cut with chaparral scrub elements.",91,30.0,Pinot Noir
49705,US,"Here's a pleasant, fruity, rich Bordeaux blend that impresses for its sheer wealth of flavor. Floods the mouth with blackberries, cherries, red and black currants and sweet, smoky oak, with firm but finely ground tannins. Feels direct and simple now, but that could be a function of youth. Try holding for 4–6 years and see where it goes.",89,40.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
48057,France,"Powerful and intense without going over the top, this is a fine example of white Hermitage. The golden straw color gives a first indication of its richness, followed by scents of honey, even a hint of butterscotch. It's unctuous in the mouth, boasting flavors of grilled nuts and stone fruits, and finishing with just a touch of warmth.",92,50.0,Rhône-style White Blend
33607,US,"Though it's a huge tannic monster right now, this Bordeaux blend, a first release and new brand name from Steven Kent Winery, is an ode to Steven Kent Mirassou's family's long lineage in California winemaking and the roots of Livermore's history in wine as well. A majority Cabernet (75%), with all the lush cassis and black cherry one would hope for, the wine shows nicely honed herbal notes from its 15% Cab Franc in the middle, with a little touch of spice on the finish coming from 5% Petit Verdot (3% Malbec and 2% Merlot round out the blend). Give this one time and it will surely reward.",94,125.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
58284,US,"Dry as a bone, with bristling minerality, this is an elegant rosé that balances penetrating strawberry, cherry and plum flavors with sharp, lime-tinged acidity and a hint of wildflower. Drink now.",88,20.0,Rosé
73565,US,"One of the first 2008 Pinots to be released, this fresh young wine has Beaujolais Nouveau-like flavors of freshly crushed cherries, with tangy acidity. It's a fun wine to drink with a juicy cheeseburger.",85,16.0,Pinot Noir
36377,US,"A very good introduction to Steven Kent's Livermore Cabernets, sourced from a handful of his single-vineyard designates, including the Ghielmetti, Home Ranch and Smith Ranch. This is 79% Cab with smatterings of Cab Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot (an up and coming varietal in Livermore), and still needs some time to develop but all the essentials are there.",89,35.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
9889,France,"Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon make a warm, blend that is full, herbal and concentrated with black fruits and dark tannins. Spice provides a reminder that this wine comes from a warm climate. Drink now, although the wine will be better from 2016.",91,40.0,Red Blend
1230,Italy,"This opens with a pretty floral fragrance of acacia, Spanish broom and chamomile. The palate doles out white peach and tangerine zest alongside fresh acidity.",87,20.0,White Blend
39975,France,"Green vegetable aromas mingle with fresh kiwi and lime and a touch of pepper and salt. The wine is going through the sort of closed-up phase common with Chenin Blanc, the fruits just a hint, the texture smooth. Give it another 3–4 years, and the fruits will come together with mature almond flavors.",91,22.0,Chenin Blanc
28105,US,"Ripe orange, lime and honey flavors combine with tingly, mouth-watering acidity to give this dry Chardonnay a sweet-and-sour taste. It's an easy wine to drink with mushroom risotto, garlic shrimp, chicken fajitas.",87,20.0,Chardonnay
4911,US,"This delicate Pinot Noir provides plenty of drinking pleasure, but it's not without limitations. Chief among them is a hint of raw, dank mushroom. It's not strong, but just enough to weigh down the raspberries and cherries. Drink it by 2016.",87,45.0,Pinot Noir
40179,US,"The shade of this Kathy Joseph creation is that of rosé-colored sunglasses. Such comfort is furthered with a cherry cola and maraschino cherry nose. A slight effervescent zing on the palate accompanies pomegranate flavors followed by an impressively long finish. Great with a fresh garden salad, but able to handle more substantial fare too, such as  breaded chicken cutlets or a cheeseburger.",89,22.0,Pinot Noir
96018,France,"Overt and round, with chunky aromas of berries and stone fruits. Quite lively and zesty, with purity of flavors. Is it a touch limited in scope and complexity? Yes. But the nectarine and orange flavors are crystalline and the mouthfeel rocks. Imported by Vranken America.",90,130.0,Champagne Blend
35291,Italy,"A pale pink sparkler with loads of intensity and elegance, Essence opens with delicate aromas of cranberry, toasted almond, mature fruit and grapefruit. The wine's perlage is steady and foamy.",90,36.0,Sparkling Blend
42798,US,Nasty. Hits the mouth with astringent green flavors and turns harsher and more bitter on the finish.,80,24.0,Zinfandel
28809,US,"This wine's excellently layered yet light nose mixes pomelo skin with tangelo and lime-spritzed pink-apple notes. The palate is extremely nervy, with grippy lemon-skin texture and squeezed-citrus flavors, all balanced by riper apple. It's like biting into a cold, crisp, just-ripe pear or nectarine.",93,30.0,Grüner Veltliner
13915,Italy,Viognier does well in warm climates and this Sicilian expression of the French grape shows pretty floral nuances backed by white almond and orange blossom. Pair this wine with sea bass grilled in lemon leaves or fried squid.,86,18.0,Viognier
20355,Spain,"Yeasty, bready aromas of cantaloupe and citrus feed into an undefined palate that foams up on tongue. Citrus and melon flavors are bland, with powdered sugar and orange notes on the finish.",82,10.0,Bobal
9558,US,"Sourced from a vineyard planted by Gary Andrus in 1998, this elegant and expressive wine is shaded a lovely rose tone, and scents of rose petals and ripe cherries emerge instantly from the glass. It's well defined, balanced and detailed with sandalwood, cocoa powder, cinnamon and orange-liqueur highlights. Drink now through 2021.",93,45.0,Pinot Noir
1862,France,The classic blend for Figeac with its 32% of Cabernet Sauvignon and 28% Cabernet Franc gives a beautifully dense wine with great tannins. The wine is perfumed while the complex tannins are finely cushioned by the generous black fruits and acidity. It is a wine for long-term aging. Drink from 2026.,97,90.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
81086,US,"This wine wears its 15.8% alcohol better than any similarly heady wine out there. Yes, it's a bit hot, but the heat comes across as a slight chili pepper edge to the blackberry and dark unsweetened chocolate flavors, and the wine is, in its own way, balanced and elegant. Hard to imagine a more perfect barbecue red.",90,31.0,Primitivo
97304,US,"Like the regular Chardonnay, Beuna Vista's regular Pinot Noir is a medium-bodied, easy-drinking version of the variety. There's enough herbal complexity to keep it interesting, but the cherry-tinged fruit is ripe and the tannins supple. Finishes with a burst of crisp acidity.",87,22.0,Pinot Noir
85860,US,"Similar to Petite Sirah, this is a dark, full-bodied red wine with significant tannins. It's dry, with berry, currant and spice flavors, and kind of rustic. Calls to mind barbecue.",85,30.0,Teroldego
77282,France,"A quite green style of Champagne, very clean and very crisp. From one of the Champagne cooperatives, this is a great value wine, with pleasing freshness. Imported by Grape Expectations of Georgia.",86,38.0,Champagne Blend
83939,US,"At first this Chaleur Estate seemed closed up tight and lightly herbal, but grudgingly opened with streaks of olive, chalk, coffee grounds. A second bottle was much brighter, layered with plum, cherry, chocolate, herb, and an impression of pepper. Subtle and sleek, this wine is built to age and needs to be decanted.",93,75.0,Red Blend
67943,US,"An elegant Cabernet that's ready to drink tonight and will hold for some years. Shows good Napa character, with lush, ripe tannins and flavors of black currants, blackberries and cedar that cry out for a good steak.",88,30.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
47513,US,"A light, entry-level red, with fresh berry aromas and a touch of dried herbs. Dry, but with an appealing softness to its texture.",85,15.0,Red Blend
41278,US,"This new Malbec is a soft, fruity, extremely dark wine, with scents of raisins and pretty fruit flavors of boysenberries and black cherries, with lighter streaks of coffee and caramel woven through. The balance is excellent, though the wine does not show the depth of flavor that is expressed in its inky dark colors.",88,28.0,Malbec
38028,France,"Light, fresh wine, showing pineapple and pear flavors, but in a delicate way. It has lift, crispness, a fine touch of citrus and a hint of toast. An attractive, easy white Burgundy. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",85,17.0,Chardonnay
36315,Spain,"Dark and deep, with cola, black fruit and truffle aromas. There's good lift to the palate, but overall it has to be classified as a dense, warm-climate wine with a big body and equally large flavors of black plum, olive and coffee. Seems short and a little simple on the finish.",87,40.0,Monastrell
77717,US,"Light and citrusy, this off-dry Riesling features pleasant floral and spice notes that just lack a little zip on the finish.",83,12.0,White Riesling
29438,US,"Stiff and tart, this young wine needs a few more years of cellaring to fill itself out. The balance is right, and the vineyard's full-bodied tannins are there in abundance.",88,28.0,Cabernet Franc
98849,US,"Thin and watery, with diluted citrus flavors and lots of raw acidity.",81,15.0,Fumé Blanc
77980,US,"Sobra is Brazilian Portuguese for leftovers. It's a Bordeaux blend, but the recipe changes every year. This is very nice and drinking well, smooth with a nicely resolved mix of black fruits, smoky wood, pepper and a bit of bacon fat.",88,24.0,Red Blend
14607,US,"A Côtes du Rhône-style blend meant to be drunk early and around a weekday meal, among Terre Rouge's easiest to drink and find wines. There's lots to like, from the wine's high-toned cherry and boysenberry aromas and flavors to its traces of black olive and jaunty, gamy pepper.",88,18.0,Rhône-style Red Blend
5438,France,"The simplest and fruitiest of the Cahors made at Gaudou, this is still a structured wine that has some firm, very young tannins that need to round out. Plenty of fruity, fresh black-currant flavor is cut by crisp acidity. The wine will need to age, so drink from 2016.",87,17.0,Malbec-Merlot
88997,US,"Burgundian technique was used in this wine, and the aromas and tastes of those techniques dominate. The wine is heavy in leesy, yeasty, toasted oak notes, which dominate, rather than subtlely support, the underlying fruit.",83,35.0,Chardonnay
34715,Spain,"Fresh smelling, with notes of green melon, apple, honey and minerals. It's more simple than complex, with crisp apple and orange flavors and then a chunky, slightly pithy finish. For under $15 this is good, casual Albariño that won't steer you wrong.",87,14.0,Albariño
51077,US,"Sourced from the Bacchus vineyard, this is an oaky, buttery Chardonnay that's fine for an every day quaffer. The oaky flavors quickly overtake fruit that is simple, clean, and apple flavored.",85,17.0,Chardonnay
3565,US,"Light and almost effervescent in the glass, this popular Grenache-based pink from Doug Margerum offers yeasty, Champagne-like aromas, soft lemon-peel scents and wet slate minerality. The palate's tingling acidity delivers chalky lime and cotton candy flavors, bound together with compelling tension.",91,21.0,Rosé
74729,US,"Made from equal amounts of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this wine was aged on the lees for more than four years, which gives it a fabulous creamy, yeasty complexity. There are tantalizing flavors of limes, orange zest, roasted hazelnuts, minerals and smoke. Absolutely wonderful now, and should hold and develop in the bottle through 2014, at least. Only 563 cases produced.",96,85.0,Sparkling Blend
63422,US,"Nice and dry, with lots of black pepper-infused wild blackberry flavors wrapped into big but pliant tannins. Lots of crunchy acidity, too, which makes the wine sharp. Will be great with a rich steak.",87,32.0,Syrah
25870,US,"A monstrous mix of Mourvèdre (89%) and Syrah (11%) from Calaveras's Dalton Vineyard, Twisted Oak's River of Skulls opens with a heady nose of bright cherry, black tea and candied dark plum and shows off bright acidity for such a pleasantly plump wine. Tannins are resolved and yet rightfully there. The long finish is enveloped in raspberry flavors.",88,35.0,Rhône-style Red Blend
67112,Italy,"Here's a bright, buoyant style of Brunello that drinks easily but also delivers the sophistication and complexity you should expect of Montalcino. It opens with crisp, tonic aromas of cassis and wild berry with very subtle aromas of vanilla and toasted nut at the back.",91,55.0,Sangiovese Grosso
54438,Italy,"Aged only in stainless steel to preserve its fresh, clean flavors, this expression of Favorita (a little-known white wine grape from northern Italy) offers lively tones of lemon zest, white blossom and cut grass.",86,16.0,Favorita
89640,US,"High in acidity and ripe in pineapple and vanilla flavors, this is a simple wine. It has sweet and sour flavors, like a sour cough drop.",83,7.0,Pinot Grigio
18786,US,"Ever since Tamber Bey made the switch from Oakville fruit to their vineyard in Yountville, their Cabernets have dropped in quality. This '09 is dry, tannic and uninteresting, with a harshness that makes it difficult to appreciate the blackberry and cherry fruit.",85,42.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
40259,Spain,"A lesson in contrasts: the nose is both weedy and sweet, with green strawberry aromas mixing with caramel. The palate is also green and slightly bitter, but that's offset by some jammy berry sweetness. Medium in terms of weight, but with burdensome sugars and a clumsy finish.",82,15.0,Tempranillo
98965,US,"Comes on a bit flat, with a streak of cardboard under the fruit. Not as fresh as it should be, given the vintage.",81,14.0,Riesling
37020,Spain,"We suggest very little time with this bulky, medicinal Tempranillo. Despite color and weight, it's prickly, sour and not too ripe. The flavors and finish are short, while the overriding impression is that it's underdeveloped.",82,11.0,Tempranillo
34925,Italy,There are brambly notes here of forest floor and underbrush backed by enough fresh fruit to keep the wine chewy and fresh in the mouth. You'll also get notes of wet tobacco and wild mushroom that add complexity.,87,22.0,Barbera
85609,Italy,"With a modern winery located at the foot of the picturesque town of Barolo, Cascina Adelaide proudly produces a bold and innovative interpretation of Barolo. This is a powerful and generous wine with big spice, berry, smoke and mineral tones. The cards it plays best, however, are intensity and persistency.",93,88.0,Nebbiolo
93975,Italy,"Here's a Prosecco from the Cartizze cru (offered by the excellent Bortolin estate) that boasts mineral notes and talc powder followed by plush, creamy peach and yellow fruit. The wine ends with a very feminine note of fresh flowers.",88,30.0,Glera
35900,France,"With its rounded texture and smooth wood and yellow fruits, this is a generous wine. It has weight and some richness tempered with acidity and a prominent apple skin character. In another few months, the wine's richness will show better.",89,45.0,Chardonnay
30219,US,"For an $18 Oregon Pinot, you can't do much better than this well-made wine from a top-flight vintage. Brambly black cherry fruit carries a streak of cola, with ripe, moderate tannins balancing out a medium-long finish.",89,18.0,Pinot Noir
821,Italy,"It opens with aromas of forest floor, porcini mushroom and espresso. The straightforward palate offers bright berry, coffee and grilled herbs alongside firm tannins. Drink 2015–2020.",88,28.0,Nebbiolo
93271,France,"Atypically dark in color, this brassy Châteauneuf blanc comes across as aromatically muted. Then it's very neutral in flavor, with ample breadth but lacking in richness and depth. It's something of a conundrum.",85,48.0,Rhône-style White Blend
82383,US,"Feels soft and cloyingly sweet in pineapple jam and buttered popcorn flavors, and is beginning to be tired and old. Drink up.",82,34.0,Chardonnay
32339,US,"Full and round, with snappy acidity that brings life and lift to the luscious fruit, this delicious wine is aimed at those who like a festival of green and yellow fruits in their glass. It has fine texture and length, with a defining mineral streak that elevates this well beyond just fruity. It has medium-term aging potential as well.",91,22.0,Chardonnay
54283,US,"This is an ultrarich, ripe Cabernet, marked by jammy blackberry, blueberry and cherry fruit flavors, with a milk chocolate sweetness and soft, intricate tannins. Made in the soft, modern style, it's best over the next six years.",90,50.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
43946,US,"A bit rugged and hot in the mouth. Offers a good array of plummy cherry flavor, with bright, zingy acidity and a touch of smoky oak.",84,16.0,Pinot Noir
49251,US,"From the steep Sonoma slopes of Mount St. Helena comes this tannic, concentrated young 100% Cabernet. Dramatic in structure and flavor, with massively packed blackberries, dark chocolate and pain grillé. The wine was aged in 49% new oak, which adds smoky, spice overtones. Drink now and through 2013.",93,40.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
9209,France,"Lightly fruity and fresh, a wine that has some crisp acidity although without much definition. The aftertaste is clean, bringing out attractive citrus and red currant fruits. Screwcap.",84,12.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
35544,US,"From one of the Russian River's premier Sauvignon Blanc producers, although recent vintages have slipped in quality. The '09 is a good wine, dry and crisp, with citrus, gooseberry and spice flavors. But it's missing the richness of earlier vintages.",87,35.0,Sauvignon Blanc
30909,Spain,"Apple and nectarine aromas are clean and snappy, with a hint of yeast-based vanilla. A fresh, citric palate delivers lime, green apple, pineapple and nectarine flavors, while the finish is clean as a new razor, with nothing off, bitter or pithy.",88,14.0,Verdejo
6152,US,"Dull and dusty on the nose, this burly Zin opens up in the glass, offering a slight sweetness of blackberry and vanilla amid its soft texture and structure.",86,22.0,Zinfandel
50031,US,"Classic Lodi Cab, from a vintage that wasn't too hot or too cool. The wine is soft and lush, with milk chocolate and cassis flavors and the vanillins and sweet char of oak. Easy and delicious, it's a wine to drink now.",88,59.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
17364,US,"This late-disgorged wine has been released at the age of 11 years. It's a beautiful wine, notable especially for the ultrafine feeling of the mousse, or bubbles. So refined and silky. Rich too are the flavors, in limes, strawberries, toasty lees and minerals. A spectacular sparkling wine that has many years of development ahead.",95,50.0,Sparkling Blend
74432,US,"Lots of zesty acidity in this Pinot Noir, giving the pomegranate, rhubarb, red cherry and licorice flavors a bright edge. The wine is very dry and complexly layered. Interesting now, if a bit primary in fruit, and balanced enough to develop additional nuances over the next six years.",92,56.0,Pinot Noir
16884,US,"Butterscotch and pineapple and peach jam flavors mark this Chardonnay. Fortunately, it's balanced with crisp acidity and a certain minerality. It's an obvious crowd pleaser, and would score higher except for the seemingly sweet finish.",85,15.0,Chardonnay
43557,Italy,"Fresh berries, young spice and raw notes of blueberry and raspberry color this bright blend of Montepulciano and Sangiovese from Central Italy. The wine is sharp and immediate in terms of the delivery of its easy tannins and bright, acidic finish.",86,10.0,Red Blend
91586,US,"Made from Tempranillo, this is a really pleasant rosé that shows a balance rare in California. Totally dry, crisp and relatively low in alcohol, the wine manages to be long and deep in creamy, spicy cherry, raspberry and vanilla bean flavors. Great job.",87,10.0,Tempranillo
62250,US,"Pungent of baked plum and baking spice, this Shenandoah Barbera is soft and rustic, yet refined, with a jolt of mocha espresso on the finish. The expert acidity enveloping this wine should pair with Mediterrean-themed food.",88,25.0,Barbera
8235,US,"Big, bold and concentrated, this full-bodied wine was given the complete new-barrel, lees-stirring treatment. It has a deep gold color, with ripe pear and buttered toast aromas that transition to waves of pear and apple on the palate and lingering finish.",91,20.0,Chardonnay
89202,US,"If you like 'em big and oaky, then this one's for you. Aromas and flavors of wood-grilled peaches, roasted red apples, buttery toast and rich nuttiness all generously abound. The mouth is full and slightly fat, with moderate acidity and a medium-length, smoky finish.",85,25.0,Chardonnay
36063,US,"A mix of vineyards and AVAs go into this blended Syrah, which is co-fermented with 6% Viognier. The Viognier is definitely present, and the wine has a top end of grapefruit and citrus, adding scent, flavor and acid. It's full, forward, acidic and a little hot, and delivers plenty of flavor up front. What's not quite there is the layering of flavors that some of the other Walter Dacon Syrahs express.",88,30.0,Syrah
18116,France,"A finely structured wine, its tannin fitting well into the rich texture, with berry fruits, dark plums and bitter coffee adding an extra dimension.",88,44.0,Malbec

75448,US,"This is the winery's flagship red; in this vintage it's 64% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot and 14% Syrah. Sturdy and structured to age, the Syrah component pops in the pepper and spice, while the Cab and Merlot give it muscle and verve. Youthful, lovely floral notes and pure, pretty berry fruits shine in this ripe but graceful wine with sweet fruit, a pleasing midpalate and a clean and textural finish.",92,42.0,Red Blend
74507,US,"Nice and smooth, this Merlot is for early drinking. It's as plump as can be in cherries, cocoa, cola and tobacco, with soft acids and even softer tannins.",85,23.0,Merlot
26424,US,"For the price, you get a Cabernet that shows some pretty good Napa character. It's ripe and forward with black currants with tough tannins and a hit of sweet oak. Lots going on, and could even age for a few years. If you drink it now, give it a couple hours of airing.",90,22.0,Cabernet Sauvignon

73311,Spain,"Candied fruit and punch bowl aromas are not what you'd call sophisticated, and the mouth pretty much follows suit with tart, rubbery raspberry fruit that comes on a bit hot and raw. Tough but with full flavor; sort of like chewing on a plum skin.",84,12.0,Mencía
2694,Italy,"Aromas of black cherry, licorice, leather, violet and a whiff of tobacco open this wine. The palate is still a bit closed but delivers black raspberry, wild cherry, anisette and a note of black pepper alongside big, brooding tannins that need time to come around. Drink 2017–2024.",90,51.0,Nebbiolo
54930,US,"Fresh, full bodied and juicy, this has flavors of dusty, dark plum and chocolate. It was aged in both French and American oak, which has added a background note of tobacco and vanilla on the palate, particularly on the finish.",87,24.0,Petite Sirah

17583,US,"Notable for its firm minerality and acidity and distinguished mouthfeel. Could be a little richer, but offers intricate raspberry, sour cherry candy, blueberry, cola and sandalwood flavors. Might blossom over the next few years. Drink now–2013.",92,58.0,Pinot Noir
33833,US,"As with its Momtazi vineyard bottling, Boedecker Cellars produced just two barrels of this Cherry Grove designate. It's a fragrant and focused effort, scented with rose petals and cherry candy, and carrying a spicy cinnamon streak into a textural, cola-laced finish.",90,50.0,Pinot Noir
3112,US,"Given the diverse clonal make-up of the vines that go in to this Pinot, the aromas are somewhat muted and shy. Earthy, spicy fruit flavors are characterized by baked red raspberry and strawberry notes, with the wine taking on a denseness on the palate and finish.",85,43.0,Pinot Noir
29953,US,"This pleasing blend yields a spicy, fruity wine with sweet strawberry and cherry candy flavors. Though two thirds new oak was used, it is not prominent. Smooth and accessible, this delicious wine is accented with aromas of sweet straw.",90,29.0,Red Blend
103591,Italy,"As much as we like the retro package, this time the contents are just too one-dimensional. The heavily toasted oak over the narrow fruit from the '98 vintage reads as just that—toast, with vanilla and coconut shadings. Dry powdery tannins mark the taut finish.",83,26.0,Sangiovese
71118,Italy,"This youthful expression of Dolcetto offers a dark, concentrated style and a very noticeable mineral tone that slices through the lush blueberry and raspberry aromas. The wine is tonic and vibrant and although there isn't huge complexity here, there is a good, fresh quality of fruit.",87,15.0,Dolcetto

16280,US,"A lovely and complex Cabernet from this mountain in the southerly Mayacamas chain.

Drinkable now for sheer decadence, although it also seems to have the stuffing to age for a decade.",92,70.0,Cabernet Sauvignon

37017,US,"It's a rustic, slightly raisiny Bordeaux blend (with a little Syrah also), sourced from excellent vineyards, but a bit overripe. Soft, forward and a little leathery, it's ready to drink up.",85,16.0,Red Blend
1956,France,"Wood aging adds a smoky character and toasty flavor, while also smoothing out the tannins. From the rich 2009 vintage, this wine shows both plum fruits and firm tannins. It could still age, drink until 2018.",90,42.0,Gamay
94761,France,"Made from 60-year-old vines, evidenced by its concentration and serious ageability. It is structured, firm and relatively dry at this young stage.

82293,US,"Made in the modern style, this Chardonnay is very ripe and rich in jammy pineapples, green apples and limes, enhanced with smoky, caramelized oak and a creamy, slightly sour note of lees.

20499,US,"Peppery and bright in acidity, this blend of half Grenache and lesser percentages of Mourvèdre, Syrah and Counoise is a bit mixed. On the one hand it offers red raspberry and pomegranate and perfumed aromatics; on the other hand, the earthiness detracts.",86,30.0,Rhône-style Red Blend
9274,US,"Just about every Dyer Cabernet requires aging. The 2009 bottling is tough with tannins, despite intense blackberry, cherry and oak flavors. The winemaker held it back from release even longer than the 2010, but it's still juvenile, with unintegrated oak, fruit and mineral notes. The window of drinkability is 2015–2025.",92,75.0,Cabernet Sauvignon

34140,US,"At the age of six-plus years, this Cab still is dominated by the 100% new French oak in which it was aged. The fruit flavor, too, is young and primary, offering sweetly ripe cherries and blackberries. Even the tannins are fresh. The suggestion is continued cellaring, and the statistics concerning alcohol, acidity and pH suggest ideal balance. Hold for at least a year and try again.",92,85.0,Cabernet Sauvignon

36433,US,"This is a devastatingly good Bordeaux blend from Howell Mountain. Based on Cabernet, it has all the flavor you could ask for in blackberries, cherries, cassis, chocolate, herbs, spices and sweetly smoked oak. But the structure is awesome. Near perfect tannins, soft and intricately firm, and grand acidity make for a total Cabernet experience. Tremendous now, and should age for years.",97,120.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
79770,US,"What a roll St. Jean has been on with Chardonnay. This wine was made from a majority of Robert Young and Belle Terre vineyard fruit, and is two-thirds new French oak. The combination is mind-blowing. The vineyards contribute concentrated spicy, tropical fruit flavors and perfect acid balance, while the oak provides elaborate seasoning. Absolutely delicious. One of the most satisfying Chards of the vintage.",96,45.0,Chardonnay
76049,US,"This is a pure Cab Franc, stylish and varietal. The new oak was limited to just 30%, giving a kick to the natural toastiness of the grape. The fruit mixes blueberries, black cherry and a streak of cassis, then runs into luscious mocha and espresso, with highlights of black pepper and cedar. The tannins have been beautifully managed.",90,32.0,Cabernet Franc
40586,US,"The 79% Syrah component is estate-grown; while the 21% Grenache comes from the Lonesome Springs vineyard. What a lovely nose, with the bright and grapey Grenache shining through and adding pretty floral scents, while the Syrah fills in the berries and peppery tannins. This is still quite purple and youthful, fresh and just a bit volatile.",88,28.0,Syrah
43569,US,"This is a challenging Zin. It's fruity but it's also earthy and mushroomy, with a blast of vanilla oak. Right now it's pretty tannic, but beneath that roughness is a core of fruit. It's austere now—difficult even—but some time in the cellar could soften and open it.",86,35.0,Zinfandel
87288,US,"Smooth and dry, with appealing flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and cedar, and a fine, spicy finish. Shows amazing style and elegance for the price. A real sommelier's bargain, with 2,853 cases produced.",88,10.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
43975,Spain,"This is a nice, traditionally styled Rioja. Delivers smooth, earthy, leathery aromas and then spicy dry fruit that's right out of Rioja 101. With good acidity, it's a very respectable table wine from a weak vintage.",87,28.0,Tempranillo
20154,Italy,"Bold and full bodied, this offers aromas of steeped plum, prune, clove and blue flower. The concentrated, savory palate doles out mature blackberry, raisin, clove and licorice. Big but velvety tannins and just enough freshness give this a surprisingly drinkable quality that belies its heft.",90,30.0,Primitivo
101572,US,"Smells very earthy and funky, with a strong hit of green pepper. More bell pepper and some cracked black pepper appear on the palate, which features some currant, licorice and lots of oak. Bright acidity helps it along, but it just can't escape its vegetal core, which holds it back.",86,30.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
56066,US,"Extraordinarily rich and ripe, showing sweet raspberry and cherry fruit flavors, enhanced with the vanilla and buttered toast of oak barrels. Brilliant acidity and wonderfully soft tannins make this Pinot instantly drinkable, yet it should age over the next 6–8 years.",94,70.0,Pinot Noir
53923,US,"Chris Dowsett makes just a single Gewürztraminer each year, always from Celilo vines planted in 1982. 2010 was the coolest vintage in two decades at this high-altitude site. If you love searing acidity, married to varietal spice, rose petals, lemons, grapefruit, star fruit and gooseberries, you are in for a treat. Fermented in neutral French oak and left on the lees, this could age for decades.",91,22.0,Gewürztraminer
29167,US,"This wine's judiciously restrained nose shows black fruits and dried herbs, with asphalt and focused rather than exuberant fig and plum aromas. There is lots of minty lift at the tip of the palate, which opens toward Mission figs, fudge and mocha.",93,30.0,Zinfandel

86996,US,"Deeply flavored and impressive, this intensely young, Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend hails from Mount Veeder. It has all the hallmarks of a wine that needs time in the cellar. The sweetly extracted black currant and licorice fruit is massive, and so is the cedary oak, which is 80% new French, while considerable mountain tannins give a hard, astringent mouthfeel. Solidly in the modern Napa style, this opulent wine should improve over the next six years, at least.",94,56.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
51635,Italy,"This wine boasts an oak-driven character, with aromas of espresso, coffee and toasted almond. The palate shows red and black fruit layered with accents of oak, chocolate and black pepper. Technically well made, it's shy on personality and length.",86,27.0,Red Blend
61436,US,"A little too soft in both acidity and tannins to have perfect structure, but it's fine enough, and the flavors certainly are complex and compelling. They range from blackberry tart and cherry pie through Dr. Pepper cola and anise liqueur to bacon and sandalwood. If that sounds good, it is. Ready now.",90,39.0,Red Blend
10268,France,"This is a well-balanced wine that is both crisp and breezy and full of delicious red-berry fruits. It has a tight texture, with some minerality and a tangy aftertaste. This should make for an excellent apéritif.",90,15.0,Rosé

1430,US,"An evenly dispersed nose of sage bark, cherry compote and lightly toasted cedar introduces this bottling by Fred Brander, a Santa Ynez Valley winemaking pioneer now actively trying to create a new Los Olivos District appellation.

33213,Italy,"This 80-20 blend of Sangiovese and Syrah from coastal Tuscany opens with bright fruit, a somewhat lean texture and delivers lively berry notes of wild strawberry and white cherry. A good value, the wine would pair well with pizza or pasta.",84,10.0,Red Blend
11965,US,"Consistent with the rather lean house style this opens with herbal aromas set against firm, varietal cassis and blue plum fruit. The grapes come from a block planted in 1985. Some barrel spice adds cinnamon to the nose, and there's a touch of Cab Franc (6%) in the blend, which stiffens up the tannins. Retasting this wine after it has spent a few extra months in bottle, it's smoothed out a bit, and the sweet black- cherry fruit has moved forward. This should age really well.",89,28.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
69146,US,"The 2007 vintage was a fabulous one for Williams Selyem, and the Zinfandels benefited from the cool, balanced growing season. The Papera is a big, rich, jammy wine, but also a drily elegant one. It offers waves of raspberry, Fig Newton, red currant and Canadian bacon flavors, with superfine tannins. An exuberant Zinfandel now and for the next six years.",94,48.0,Zinfandel
25969,US,"Complicated, at times confusingly dank aromas of mushrooms, hops, dill and other wet herbs emerge from this bottling. Those atypical varietal characters find their way onto the palate as well, with olive and stewed mushrooms leading the way.",84,50.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
28997,France,"Still way too young, this is developing into a substantial and structured wine. Full of both fruit and tannins, it is dark and dense, very dry at this stage but with the most enticing perfumes.

52507,US,"This is a great Napa Valley Merlot, from a winery with a generally good track record with the variety. The grapes were grown in the Coombsville region, although they were allowed to get very ripe, resulting in fairly high alcohol and rich cherry, berry, dark chocolate and anise flavors. It's notable for grippy tannins that give it a firm, dry mouthfeel.",92,42.0,Merlot
19181,US,"This is a silly name, and it's not a very good wine. Acids and tannins dominate, making it astringent and bitter, and the cherry fruit is thin and rather overripe.",82,60.0,Sangiovese
9991,US,"Though not planted until 2001, the east-facing Lone Oak Vineyard is adjacent to the legendary vines of Garys' and Rosella's.

54665,US,"A gorgeously salmon-colored rosé made predominantly from Grenache (62%) co-fermented dry with Viognier (58%) out of Yolo County. The wine has a delicately pretty nose of peach and a light-medium body despite its 14.8% alcohol, though the finish falls off fast.",86,18.0,Rosé
24824,France,"The most impressive of the fine range of wines from this producer, the wine is structured and dense without ever losing sight of balance, fruit and acidity.

Drink from 2019.",95,60.0,Malbec
38757,US,"Searing acidity marks this wine, which tastes like it has a lot of Edna Valley fruit in the blend. It also shows bright, strong, long hangtime flavors of limes and pineapples. It's actually quite a fine Chardonnay, dry and low in alcohol. A great value at this price.",89,15.0,Chardonnay
67070,US,"This elegant effort is 46% Cab Sauvignon, 36% Merlot and 18% Cab Franc; still wrapped up tight and showing tart cassis and berry fruit. There is a lot of the classic Ciel minerality underlying the fruit, with hard tannins and lightly peppery herbal details. At just 14.1% alcohol, this is a classic example of how Washington brings bright New World fruit and terroir to a style that retains the elegance of the Old World.",91,40.0,Red Blend
76194,Italy,"Pretty notes of Italian espresso, chocolate and spice revolve around a core of solid black fruit.

67447,US,"Bold and striking aromas of mushroom, seaweed and organic funk set this apart from the other Ken Wright vineyard designates.

This is a wine that could score even higher with additional bottle age.",91,50.0,Pinot Noir
66870,US,"This is ripe and pungent, a rich and fruit-driven mix of fig, peach and melon. There are interesting herbal highlights, and more acidity than in the past.

69844,US,"Firm and compact, it mixes wild berry, plum and cassis fruits, giving this Cab-dominated blend the sleek appeal of a good St. Emilion, but without the aggressive herbaceousness. There is no obvious new oak here, but lovely suggestions of barrel that never override the superb fruit.",90,50.0,Red Blend
8586,US,"No, that's not a typo. The ??? Vineyard bottling conceals (intentionally) the fruit sources for these grapes, which come from one of Oregon's most expensive and highly-reviewed producers. It's crystal-clear in both appearance and flavor, building upon a cranberry/raspberry base into a potent young wine with expressive purity. A streak of gun metal, often found in consulting winemaker Robert Brittan's own wines, adds a stylish note to the finish.",94,55.0,Pinot Noir
69630,Italy,"Some wines have a personality that makes you want to smile. This is one of them. A big, rich, friendly wine full of fruit that was approachable and easy to drink.

It's also a masculine, opulent wine that could use a few more years of cellar aging.",91,50.0,Sangiovese Grosso
36859,US,"A beautiful Chardonnay, notable for its elegant structure. Perfect acidity and just a hint of tannins, much of it from oak barrels, provide the framework for the pineapple and kiwi fruit flavors, enriched with notes of cream and buttered toast.",93,40.0,Chardonnay

1549,Spain,"Aromas of raw oak, cinnamon, bacon and clove outmuscle fruit on this rough, tannic, scraping 2013.

Give it a good 4 years, at least, to throw some sediment and let the rich blackberry and black currant flavors emerge. Should hold well for 15 years.",92,75.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
27496,US,"Fans of the ripe, modern style of Chardonnay will fall in love with this bottling. It's strong in toast, buttered popcorn, vanilla cream and peach, pear and pineapple jam flavors that dazzle and wow the palate. Easy to find, with nearly 17,000 cases produced.",87,22.0,Chardonnay

17055,US,"Unbalanced, with lots of acidity, hard tannins and raisiny flavors alongside green ones.",82,27.0,Zinfandel
85131,US,"A very nice Syrah, dark and dry and full-bodied. Although it's a bit young and thick in jammy, primary fruit flavors, it's smooth and balanced. With rich blackberry pie, chocolate, violet, beef carpaccio, bacon and pepper flavors, it should develop through 2011.",91,34.0,Syrah
87357,US,"Fruity and easy, this soft wine has sweet flavors of apricots and caramel. Valdiguié, formerly known as Napa Gamay, is a red grape, and that accounts for the note of crushed raspberries.",84,17.0,Viognier-Valdiguié
59381,Italy,"Here is a beautifully extracted and voluptuous Barolo from the Cannubi cru that would pair with tender veal shank, slow cooked until falling off the bone. Black cherry, spice, root beer and fragrant earthy tones all appear on the nose and the wine closes with tight, firm structure. Cellar age ten years or more.",93,95.0,Nebbiolo
98926,US,"A Bordeaux blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, the grapes for this stunning wine came from David Abreu's vineyard in the St. Helena foothills. It's very complex, softer, more open and approachable than Colgin's 100% Cabs, with a flamboyant spectrum of cherries,  framboise, cocoa, violets, gingerbread and spices framed in supple, fine tannins. Beautiful, a feminine wine of great beauty. Drink now through 2015.",95,225.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
64710,Italy,"Here's a pale and luminous rosé from Southern Italy with a pinkish-peach color and delicate aromas of stone fruit, wild berries, white cherries and a touch of chopped mint or basil. The wine is tart but also slightly sweet in the mouth and there's a touch of bitter almond on the close.",85,15.0,Rosé
80079,Spain,"Full, roasted and earthy on the nose, with only some coconut and berry aromas to sweeten things up. Tight, level and structured in the mouth, with roasted raspberry and plum along with oaky, buttery, smoky accents that confirm the wine's “roble” designation. Good but with some excess oak to process.",86,18.0,Tempranillo
52811,Italy,"Here's an absolutely terrific, but informal sparkling rosé from southern Italy (made with Negroamaro grapes). Sweet berry, chopped mint and peach come to the fore and the wine is soft and slightly sweet. It's easy, fresh and would make a great cocktail choice.",86,10.0,Negroamaro
77955,Spain,"Dark, sweet and candied on the nose, with hints of raisin and licorice that become more prominent in the mouth. Saturated but also somewhat monotone and single-leveled in terms of flavor, where you get a narrow band of sweet black cherry and raisin in front of a short finish. Very nice as always, but not the best Allende we've reviewed.",89,26.0,Tempranillo
37665,US,"Although this is Ste. Michelle's widely available Merlot offering, it breaks the mold by being held back a considerable time prior to release. It's an unusual wine, with scents of overripe, raisined fruit, a streak of tobacco and black licorice, a soft midpalate, and some bitterness in the finishing tannins.",84,16.0,Merlot
99672,France,"The dilute, grapey flavors are candied, and a pile of charred lumber doesn't make them go down any easier. A simple wood-and-juice quaff.",81,7.0,Syrah

77595,US,"Amador Foothill does a good job with Sangiovese, and this dry rosé is made from that variety. It's a cheerful wine, brisk in acidity and with delicate but complex cherry, rose petal and lavender flavors. The winemaker recommends bouillabaisse, which is a pretty good suggestion.",86,11.0,Sangiovese
57160,US,"Veneered with oak, the nose bears strong aromas of carpenter's shop and charred sugar, with notes of dark stone fruit and cranberry sauce lingering beneath. While initially soft and syrupy, the midpalate gains some tannic traction. Raw meat and blackberry flavors mark the juicy finish.",84,23.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
47874,Spain,"Dark as night, and dominated by meaty plum and beef jerky aromas. The palate is huge, with pure fruit, tannin and chocolate pooling at the finish.

70715,US,"This epitomizes Dry Creek Valley Zinfandel. It's dry, briary and brambly, with wild berry, cola and crisped bacon flavors. It's incredibly spicy, offering everything from black and white pepper to nutmeg, anise and clove. The texture is a delight—silky and gently tannic. While the official alcohol is 13.7%, it tastes warmer.",90,24.0,Zinfandel
40250,Spain,"Airén is a big-crop white grape that is usually distilled into brandy or made into Sherry. But here we see it as a dry white table wine, and while it is limited in scope, the wine's punch-bowl approach and cleansing lime and kiwi flavors are decent.",83,8.0,Airen
92997,US,"Rather tough and astringent now, with crunchy, dry tannins and acidity dominating. These are very fine vineyards but the vintage was so-so. With its core of cherries, red currants and cola, it could develop over the next six years.",88,70.0,Pinot Noir
100226,France,"Spice and blackcurrant aromas are combined with solid tannins and powerful wood flavors to give a spectacular, polished style, a contrast to the  often rustic wines that come from this appellation.

38370,US,"There's so much oak on this Pinot Noir, you might think you were tasting a dessert made with vanilla cream and toasted meringue, like the crust on a baked Alaska. Under all that, loads of ripe raspberries and cherries. Shows the excellent hallmarks of a fine Santa Rita Pinot Noir, but certainly is one of the oakier versions.",90,95.0,Pinot Noir
127,Spain,"Aromas of white flowers, stone fruits and lees are typical of well-made Albariño. A juicy, elegant palate with a mix of citrus and stone-fruit flavors is lasting, with a hint of pithy character coming up on the finish.",90,17.0,Albariño

50244,Italy,"D'Alessandro's plump Syrah is a bold and generous red wine, with richly layered aromas of cherry, blackberry, rum cake, bacon fat and toasted nut. Pair this wine with abbacchio arrosto (roast lamb).",88,20.0,Syrah

103427,Italy,"Very dark espresso, leather and black plum aromas and flavors. The mouthfeel is full and balanced by good acidity. The very dry, long finish shows tar, licorice and bitter chocolate flavors, along with some tannins to shed. Time should allow the solid fruit to come from behind the lavish toast that now veils it.",87,20.0,Sangiovese
81155,US,"Soft and simple, with candied peach and pear flavors and some oaky, leesy influence that makes it a little fancier.",83,9.0,Chardonnay

58240,US,"A first-class Cabernet, this is dry, richly tannic and mouthwateringly tart in acidity. It shows savory blackberry and cherry flavors, while the oak gives it an umami tang of smoke. Drink now-2016.",93,55.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
73175,US,"Fogarty's basic '05 Chard shows an exciting crispness and minerality that, good as it is, makes you long for the single-vineyard bottlings to come. There's an elegant angularity to the wine despite the succulent pineapples, kiwis and new oak, and a brisk acidity that makes it finish vibrantly clean.",90,28.0,Chardonnay
8093,US,"This wine has some good blackberry and oak flavors. But the strong, green hit of vegetable is distracting.",80,22.0,Petite Sirah

85763,US,"Power characterizes this Bordeaux blend, which is mainly Cabernet Sauvignon. It's strong in primary fruit, showcasing blackberries, black cherries, plums, carob and cola, and also strong in tannins, with a brisk, scoury mouthfeel. Add dryness, and you have a young, fresh wine of some charm and limited ageability. Now, with decanting, and through 2013.",90,50.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend

22256,France,"Medium-intense scents of dark berries and black plum unfold in the bouquet of this wine, with soft hints of vanilla, toast and garrigue in the background. The mouthfeel is robust and gripping, with skin-driven fruit flavors and solid tannins that stay through the finish.",88,17.0,Rhône-style Red Blend

87698,Italy,"This is a genuine but simple interpretation of Barbera d'Asti Superiore with fresh fruit layers and vibrant tones of cherry, cranberry and pomegranate. This easy-pairing food wine boasts cleansing acidity, medium density and a polished finish.",87,18.0,Barbera
45568,US,"Pure Red Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon fruit brings sexy flavors of wild berry and cassis. This vintage has bright acids and fairly tamed tannins, and the fruit pops out with lovely cherry flavors. Maybe not as concentrated as some past vintages, but beautifully proportioned, accessible and still ageworthy over the medium term.",91,38.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
72017,US,"Parducci's '03 True Grit was a sensation. The '04 is a worthy successor. Dry, tannic and amazingly rich, it floods the mouth with blackberry, cherry, currant, leather, coffee, carob and peppery spice flavors that go on and on in the finish. Like any great young Petite Sirah, it will age for many years.",93,25.0,Petite Sirah
49498,Spain,"Perfectly nice, but ultimately basic in its approach. The nose is initally dry and woodsy, with plenty of balsam. Later on, the palate reveals a previously unseen black cherry element, while the finish is crisp and lean. Drink now.",85,11.0,Tempranillo
52578,Italy,"This full and generous red wine from Umbria is aged 18 months in casks, 18 months in small barrel and 18 months in the bottle before its release.

That firm structure is still very apparent and the wine ends with cherry, spice, and bold, super-ripe raspberry.",89,55.0,Sagrantino

47495,US,This pleasant effort is light and cherry-flavored. It shows little evidence of any barrel flavors despite aging in 100% French oak. The tannins stiffen up and give it a bit of backbone.,87,19.0,Pinot Noir

6071,France,A certain creamy nuttiness is suggested on the nose. The sunniness of 2015 is expressed by a generous mirabelle ripeness. The body still is very slight and subtle and all about a graceful texture. There's a lovely touch of lemon freshness on the finish.,91,27.0,Sylvaner
65939,Italy,"This is a bright pink rosé with a full bouquet of berry and floral aromas but also a pungent point of chemical or solvent at the back that creates an awkward first impression. The wine is bright, firm and crisp on the palate.",82,11.0,Rosé
226,Italy,"Made from vineyards throughout the village of Serralunga d'Alba, this straightforward wine is still closed. It reveals black cherry, espresso, prune and subtle oak alongside a note of tire rubber. It's still extremely young, with aggressive tannins that dry out the finish.",88,49.0,Nebbiolo
56192,Italy,"An 80-20 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, this shows a pristine, polished bouquet that's composed of black fruit, rum cake, licorice, tobacco and spice.

9341,France,"This wine comes from Gascony, where the Gascon and his famous beret are inseparable.

Drink now.",87,13.0,White Blend
93411,US,"Firehouse Red is Tamarack's bread-and-butter wine, and rightfully so. Though it's a mélange of Cabernet, Syrah, Merlot, Franc, Malbec and more, it pulls itself into focus with spicy, slightly high-toned fruit, bright and herbal. The mix of tart red fruit, nettles and wild herbs bring a lot of complexity to what is essentially a mutt wine.",88,20.0,Red Blend
3502,US,"This quite tart, young and spicy red pulls sharp and puckery cranberry fruit into focus. It's best enjoyed chilled, and would be a fine option for the base of a wine punch.",87,17.0,Dolcetto
89432,US,"Heavy and dull in the mouth. They seemed to have picked the darkest, ripest, softest, plummiest lots, and then plastered the wine with oak. Not bad for a Grenache, but lacks the vibrancy and lift you want from Pinot Noir.",84,42.0,Pinot Noir
51017,US,"Ripe, pure flavors of tropical fruits, Meyer lemons, limes and peaches mark this lovely Chardonnay. New French oak adds luscious notes of buttered toast. With crisp acidity and a clean, spicy finish, it's a beautiful Chard to drink now.",91,28.0,Chardonnay
24867,US,"Warm spice and oak tones accent fresh apples and lemons on this full-bodied Chardonnay. It's not subtle with a dense slick of caramel that extends along the midpalate, but a kick of lemon-lime acidity on the finish adds some levity.",86,25.0,Chardonnay

49728,US,"Oddly sweet and medicinal, with sugary apricot and orange soda flavors and deficient acidity.",80,15.0,Viognier
64665,Spain,"More familiar and less unusual than prior vintages. This wine deals typical, upright lemon, lime and tropical fruit aromas backed by green apple and lemon-based flavors. With good acidity and an even keel, it is a solid, fresh, dry Albariño that should not disappoint. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",88,27.0,Albariño
41413,US,"Not one of the best Cabs from this venerable winery. Despite a cool vintage, there's a burnt edge to the blackberry pie filling flavors. Tasted in late 2007, the tannins are very astringent, and shut down the palate. Could show better after 2008.",85,38.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
13561,Italy,"The region of Lazio in central Italy is not well-known for its wines, but this well-priced 50-50 blend of Montepulciano and Merlot shows its enological potential. This is a rich and penetrating wine with loads of black fruit and spice.",87,13.0,Red Blend
5884,US,"Dry and succulent, this brings tangy flavors of rhubarb and raspberry into focus. It's made for picnic foods—could anything be better with fried chicken? This is widely available and scores a bullseye if your target is a summer sipper.",89,14.0,Rosé
42252,US,"Starts off with oaky, jammy aromas of cherries and raspberries, and tastes a little sweet in fruit pastry, with the baked crust. Seems a little one-dimensional, although that dimension is a very delicious one. Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec.",87,80.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
92627,Spain,"Muruve is a label worth watching in Toro. The wines are not as brawny and robust as some, and instead they offer more reserved pleasures.

95272,US,"A little sugar goes a long way. This dessert wine is primarily Ain, with a splash of Muscat and Viognier. It's quite sweet, with apricot, tangerine, peach, honey and dusty spice flavors. This would be a great wine if the flavors were more concentrated.",87,35.0,White Blend
46405,France,"Considering the reputation of Lynch-Bages as a rich, polished wine, it is not surprising that, in 2003, the team of Jean-Michel Cazes and Daniel Lhose produced a superlatively ripe, opulent wine, one that could almost have come from Napa.

3221,US,"Of all the 2012 releases from Mannina, this is the most dense, dark and substantial.

24177,US,"This is a heavy-duty Cabernet, big in every way, with rich black cherry and cassis fruit, and dense, dark tannins.

76248,France,"Delicious and inviting with notes of eucalyptus, chocolate-covered cherries and wild raspberries on the nose.

7389,US,"While light-bodied, gentle and intricate, this wine offers plenty of flavor nuances.

It's a treat to sip and savor.",91,39.0,Pinot Noir
26429,US,"Distinctive aromas of beeswax and bee pollen continue with similar flavors, wrapped around tart yellow apple fruit. It's lovely, fragrant and ageworthy, in a high-acid Euro mold, but give it plenty of time to breathe. Decanting is a good idea.",90,17.0,Pinot Blanc
58661,US,"The grape's fruit flavors of blackberry and black cherry are nicely focused and rounded, but the vanilla and tobacco components, perhaps from aggressive oak treatment, bring in a bit of bitterness to the tannins. It's a fight to the finish—fruit or tannin—and too soon to pick a winner.",86,25.0,Malbec

6770,France,"Roughly equal parts Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre, this is probably Lirac's top wine at the moment. It's big and rich in the mouth, leaving behind a coating of dark fruit, hints of meaty savoriness, baking spices and softly layered wood.",93,43.0,Rhône-style Red Blend
48644,Spain,"Blackberry and cola are the prime aromas that comprise the alluring bouquet. And as you'd expect, there's also leather and spicy wood thrown in.

81567,US,"Very few wineries got Walla Walla grapes in this freeze year, and even L'Ecole, which owns a piece of the Seven Hills vineyard, had to rely on other sources for many of its wines.

56917,US,"Very similar to the 2006, Kameron's '07 Bordeaux blend, which is based on Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, is upfront in blackberry, cherry, cassis, oak and spice flavors.

75658,US,"Comes down on the rustic side, but for the price it's pretty good for a dry Cabernet. Shows the variety's full-bodied fanciness in the blackberry, currant, cocoa and licorice flavors, with a rich steak of vanilla oak.",85,10.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
35835,US,"Aging quickly, this tastes principally of raisins and brown sugar. The tannins are soft and the wine is at or slightly past its peak. Drink up.",84,30.0,Pinot Noir
13179,US,"A rich Chardonnay, with plenty to offer. It's creamy and smooth in the mouth, with dry flavors of citrus, tropical fruit, vanilla and buttered toast, and brisk, clean acidity.",87,18.0,Chardonnay
980,France,"This range of wines comes from different regions of the southwest. The white comes from Gascony and is typical local blend. It is crisp and fruity with a soft texture from the ripe Colombard. There is a light dancing character to this lively, fruity wine. Drink now.",85,11.0,Colombard-Sauvignon Blanc
17425,Spain,"Ultraconcentrated and almost heavy on the nose, but not fully syrupy or leaden. Has a heavy disposition in the mouth, with brown sugar, caramel and other usual suspects making up the flavor profile. Creamy and chunky on the finish. Excellent dessert wine for the price.",91,14.0,Pedro Ximénez
73347,Italy,"This is gorgeous with a delicate but intense bouquet of pressed rose, wet earth, licorice cola and dried berry fruit. The mouthfeel is incredibly long and silky.",93,55.0,Nebbiolo
15866,France,"A soft, fat, caramel-flavored wine, showing strawberry fruits and a creamy texture. It lacks acidity, leaving a wine that needs to be drunk soon.",84,22.0,Rosé
6144,US,"The dryness and low alcohol are praiseworthy, but more challenging are hard tannins and biting acidity. With blackberry and sweet green-herb flavors, it's the opposite of today's ripe cult style, but by no means unattractive.",86,25.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
10630,US,"A good, dry, elegant wine, fully ready to drink now with a nice steak. It's a complex Merlot, with layers of black cherries, licorice, cola and spices, as well as a pleasant touch of smoky oak.",87,18.0,Merlot
17599,Italy,"Rusciano is a blend of Syrah and Nero d'Avola that displays impressive depth and complexity. Aromas of dark fruit, spice, black currant and earthy tobacco build in intensity as the wine evolves in the glass. The finish is smooth and rich.",90,32.0,Red Blend
100075,Italy,"With its deep, tart-sweet black-plum aromas and flavors wrapped in a toasty oak blanket, this is an appealing, modern-style Barbera. The grape's native acidity is well tamed, but enough remains to make it a great food match. Has good tannic structure, yet has immediate appeal. Finishes long, dark and handsome.",88,17.0,Barbera
9161,France,"Generous and rounded, this wine combines the opulence of Volnay with a strongly tannic character coming from the old vines. Together, it's a rich, fruit-filled wine that is backed by a dry core and fragrant red berry acidity. Drink from 2018.",92,64.0,Pinot Noir
9434,US,"The aromas seem quite dried out, with notes of fruit leather, medicine cabinet and green herbs. The palate brings more of the same, seeming more advanced than its age might indicate.",87,34.0,Cabernet Franc
27963,France,"Crisp and fruity, this is a classic rosé. It shows a lightness that comes from the delicately handled fruits, giving gentle berry flavors, bright acidity and a textured aftertaste.",88,20.0,Rosé
46601,US,"For fans of grassy, gooseberry-accented wines. Lemon and lime show here, too, with decent acidity. Tiny amounts of Semillon and Chardonnay add dimension. It's fruity and simple, very clean (as you'd expect), a touch sweet and finishes swiftly.",84,10.0,Sauvignon Blanc
9473,US,"This tasty, toasty red wine is all Sangiovese. The tangy red berry fruit flavors carry highlights of peppery herbs. With some air time the wine smoothes out and rolls into a creamy, mocha-infused finish.",90,29.0,Sangiovese
71987,US,"Very ripe and almost sweet in jammy, pie-filling cherries and raspberries, with a rich seasoning of cinnamon, brown sugar and cocoa. But it's technically dry, and has a crispness from fine Arroyo Seco acidity. Drink now.",87,35.0,Pinot Noir
103125,US,"A pretty wine with aromas of black-cherry liqueur and a dash of espresso, or maybe it's the other way around. Round, full and lushly flavored. The high acidity gives it real bite; in fact, the finish is somewhat bitter because of it. Food will soften it up nicely.",86,20.0,Merlot
15267,Italy,"This easy Sangiovese should pair with a pizza or a grilled ham and cheese sandwich. There are mild fruit flavors here, followed by sun-drenched aromas of leather and spice.",83,8.0,Sangiovese
30542,US,"The excellent aromas show the muscle and meat typical of the better Syrahs, and the concentrated palate is a well-crafted blend of brambly berry, pepper, sea salt, cured meat and loam.",90,20.0,Syrah
67031,US,"Very consistent in style with previous vintages, this textural, lemony, racy Riesling seems bone dry, though it is noted as having 1% residual sugar. Along with rich flavors of grapefruit and citrus, there are nectarine and pear fruit highlights and a sharp minerality.",92,24.0,Riesling
6578,Italy,"This opens with earthy aromas of scorched soil, overripe plum, leather and a funky whiff of farmyard. On the palate, notes of game, clove and sage join raw red cherry offset by bracing tannins.",87,25.0,Nebbiolo
83663,US,"A delicious and interesting white wine, made from a variety more usually used for blending purposes. It's honey-rich but dry, similar in structure to an oaky Chardonnay, with tropical fruit and vanilla flavors that have a pleasant touch of bitterness.",90,30.0,Grenache Blanc
84266,Italy,"This is a bright and fruit-forward red wine from Piedmont in Northern Italy that exhibits prominent, but not overly intense or intrusive, aromas of fresh fruit, exotic spice and drying mineral. The wine has a fresh acidic component balanced by a jammy, sweet finish.",90,45.0,Barbera
72340,US,"Simple and seemingly sweet, this Chardonnay has apricot jam flavors.",81,11.0,Chardonnay
42784,US,"With too much oak and too sweet fruit, the result is an unbalanced Chardonnay. It tastes like LifeSaver lemon candies cooked into a baked Alaska dessert.",82,30.0,Chardonnay
98565,US,"Firm and muscular, this delivers powerful, concentrated red currant, cherry and berry fruit, tightly wrapped and resonant. Young and compact, the wine just begins to hint at the complexity it contains, with notes of herb, leaf and barrel spice. Good weight and concentration, plus exceptional length and precision.",92,55.0,Merlot
12524,US,"Very ripe, with sun-enriched blackberry, cherry and mocha flavors, and rich in sweet, dusty tannins. The finish on this polished, gentle Cab is a little sweet and oaky. Drink now.",86,24.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
59803,US,"Here's a Cabernet to age for a while. It's very dry and richly flavored in classic varietal flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar, with finely ground, intense tannins. But it has a youthful immaturity that simply isn't ready to appreciate now. Really needs time for all the parts to mesh together. Give it until 2012, and it should develop bottle complexity for another 5–6 years.",92,100.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
58805,France,"This is bizarrely perfumed: It tastes like a candy shop smells, with a note of fruit jelly. The tannins are taut, but the wine doesn't hang together.",82,19.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
33019,US,"This wine in a box is simple and direct, with pineapple, lime and peach flavors that are sugary sweet. But it's crisp and clean in acidity, and the box is the equivalent of four regular bottles.",83,20.0,White Blend
29049,US,"From both Muscat Canelli (65%) and Muscat Giallo (35%), this fragrant and inviting wine is exactly what it proclaims to be, slightly sweet in honeysuckle, citrus and crisp texture. It offers lightness and lingering acidity in a moderate-alcohol package.",90,16.0,Muscat
44669,US,"Aged in American oak, with mostly similar vineyard sources. The American oak, with more spice to the fruit, and less smoothness overall than the C'est Belle Bottling. Cherry and berry flavors abound; it's sturdy, solid and well-made. Just 170 cases produced.",88,35.0,Syrah
80019,France,"The complexities of Burgundy! This is the vineyard next to the more familiar Les Charmes, just up the slope—hence dessus, meaning above. This vineyard gives a mineral character, hinting at Chablis, but with some Meursault richness as well. Hold this wine, with its delicious vanilla flavors, and it will be ready in a year.",93,69.0,Chardonnay
82658,US,"Porty and dull. Almost undrinkable, except for some decent berry and currant flavors.",80,22.0,Tempranillo
100304,Italy,"Smells like ripe peaches with hints of anise and almond. Tastes similar, with a plump mouthfeel that carries the flavors across the palate to a short but pleasant finish. Nice as an apéritif, or with mildly flavored fish or poultry.",87,23.0,Cortese
90771,Italy,"This wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller percentages of Alicante and Petit Verdot that render a soapy, herbal nose with accents of root beer, exotic spice, lavender potpourri and green pepper corn. It is very well balanced.",92,55.0,Red Blend
38553,US,"Very dry and fairly tannic, it's severe on first sip and hard to appreciate, although there are some good black cherry, cola, leather, oak and black pepper flavors. It's complex in its own way, and gets better as it breathes in the glass. Give it a good, long decanting, and drink it now through 2018. The blend is Mourvèdre, Grenache, Syrah and Counoise, in that order.",90,55.0,Rhône-style Red Blend
56668,Spain,"Waxy on the nose, with buttercup, creamy yellow-fruit scents and white flowers. The palate is wet, racy and a touch like soda, with sweet, candied flavors of peach and melon. Plods along with good enough acidity to support the wine's core sweetness and candied qualities.",86,15.0,Chardonnay
85732,Spain,"Starts out rustic and leathery, with hints of smoke, leafiness and earth along with baked berry and spice. This four-grape wine has good density and mouthfeel that frames leather, earth and slightly baked berry fruit flavors. Finishes chocolaty and sweet, with just enough acidity to maintain balance.",89,15.0,Red Blend
65616,US,"A wonderfully dry, minerally Sauvignon Blanc. It's set off by crisp acidity, and has rewarding flavors of lemons, grapefruits and limes, enriched with pineapples, figs and honeysuckle.",88,12.0,Sauvignon Blanc
34966,US,"Firm, a bit astringent and dry, with ripe flavors of blackberries, currants, black cherries and cedar. A solid Cabernet with some raw edges that might age out in a few years.",87,38.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
9368,US,"Dripping in earth, kir and fresh raspberry, this is a stellar wine from the heart of the appellation, estate-grown from a four-acre spot planted to a trio of clones. Spirited and refreshing, it dances in acidity and a floral back note that's compelling, wrapped in cinnamon and mocha.",94,42.0,Pinot Noir
79358,US,"Has all the hallmarks of Viognier, namely lots of tropical fruit, wildflower, vanilla and spicy aromas and flavors, and finishes thoroughly dry. Could use more brightness and zest, though, as it's a bit flat.",83,24.0,Viognier
76952,Italy,"Smokey tones of charcoal and dark granite or slate rise from the nose of this Lazio-based Petit Verdot. Dusty mineral notes are followed by dark, ripe fruit and the wine is long-lasting and penetrating on the close.",88,24.0,Petite Verdot
98297,US,"Kind of tough in the mouth at this time, with aggressive tannins that effectively bury the blackberry flavors. There's also a streak of hung meat or smoky leather that adds dimension. Best to let it soften for a few years.",87,26.0,Zinfandel
74833,Italy,"This is a difficult wine to understand, with a very specific philosophy behind it. Light, elegant and ethereal, the 60-40 blend of Nero d'Avola and Frappato is aged in terracotta amphorae in a studied attempt to present as pure a product as nature allows. It offers loads of bright fruit, wild berries, earth, spice and impressive complexity.",91,40.0,Red Blend
46438,Italy,"Here's an oak-aged Chardonnay from northern Italy that offers the bright intensity of peach, melon and yellow flower backed by the elegance of toast and roasted nut. The wine is creamy and soft in the mouth with some bitter almond notes on the close.",88,30.0,Chardonnay
99683,US,"Defines a style entirely separate from Napa's. Has those rustic Dry Creek tannins and even a briary edge to the blackberries and cherries, and is totally dry. Well-made and elegant.",88,13.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
90189,US,"Oaky and ripe, with powerful tropical pineapple, kumquat, mineral and floral aromas and flavors. New oak adds smoke, vanilla and char. The bottom line is of a flavorful, acidic and elegant Chard with a lingering, spicy finish.",90,28.0,Chardonnay
92483,Spain,"Smooth and ripe smelling, with clean berry aromas. Cherry, plum and pepper are the lead flavors, and the feel is tangy, zippy and clampy, but exceedingly fresh. Not a lot of richness, depth or body here, but it's pure, clean wine with common appeal.",87,14.0,Tempranillo
15243,US,"Just a single barrel was made, pure Sangiovese from the Candy Mountain Vineyard. Tight, tart and dark, it captures black cherry fruit with black licorice and a whiff of smoke. At this point in time the tannins and acids seem to be fighting it out for control.",88,50.0,Sangiovese
13506,US,"Something like a cross between a silky Pinot Noir and a soft Merlot, this is a gentle, fruity wine, with berry, tobacco, cola and spice flavors. A nice scour of tannins suggests this will pair with rich, oily meats and cheeses.",86,16.0,Sangiovese
30055,US,"Simple cherry fruit, with a delicately earthy base, defines this everyday Merlot. It keeps its herbal component in check, balanced appropriately against rather light fruit.",87,18.0,Merlot
5707,US,"Date and tar notes come nuanced with a funky, sweat-like aroma. The palate feels lax on attack, and it tastes a bit thin on flavor. Firm, upper-lip-grabbing tannins mark the finish.",83,26.0,Merlot
4900,France,"It's certainly tannic and tough at the moment, the wine also has so much fruit. That will allow it to round out, bringing out the black currant fruitiness and resulting in a full, rich and perfumed wine. Wait until 2018.",88,24.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
60657,US,"Crisp and refreshing with notes of grated ginger, white flowers and cantaloupe. This dry Riesling balances peachy fruit flavors with a steely backbone of slate and lime, tart acidity and a pleasantly long finish. Lovely all around.",89,16.0,Riesling
80671,US,"This is light and generic, the sort of low-priced Merlot that California cranks out by the boatload. Washington can do better. There's a spiffy new label, but where's the beef?",82,9.0,Merlot
19934,US,"Intense blueberry and blackberry notes penetrate through this fruity, forward Pinot Noir. Hints of savory herbs add elegance to an otherwise one-dimensional palate that finishes with big, coarse tannins.",84,22.0,Pinot Noir
44256,US,"Easy to like for its crisp, mouthwatering acidity and flavors of lemons and limes, figs and vanilla. A nice, everyday wine to drink with roast chicken or as a cocktail sipper.",85,19.0,Pinot Gris
89469,France,"With its tobacco and fresh raspberry aromas, this is a light, perfumed, smoky wine of fragrant Cabernet Franc with a touch of blueberry tannins and an intense burst of finishing acidity.",85,14.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
40930,US,"The Chelan region is Washington's newest AVA, but already showing great potential for Syrah, as this aromatic and explosively flavorful bottle proves. Ripe berries, plums and cherries are swept into a mix of smoke and rock and iron filings; as you taste through the wine there are citrusy acids and hints of resin and tar; it just keeps adding in the nuances.",90,27.0,Syrah
46436,France,"Well structured, balanced, giving tannins as well as acidity to balance fruit that moves in the direction of sweet plums, with hints of coffee and vanilla spice. The wine has a texture that promises aging, but also has a delicious juicy character.",91,55.0,Pinot Noir
16828,US,"Huge flavors of jammy blackberries and cherries dominate this Syrah, with a coating of sweet, caramelized oak. It's yummy, but not especially complex. Drink now.",86,26.0,Syrah
75533,US,"Thick and soft, this wine has simple, sweetish medicinal flavors of cherry and black raspberry Lifesavers. The oak just adds vanilla.",82,29.0,Merlot
64063,US,"Ripeness is both this wine's blessing and its challenge. It's super-fruit in jammy blackberries, blueberries, currants and cherries, brightened by that famous Edna Valley acidity. But it's all on the surface, without much complexity. So drink now.",86,24.0,Syrah
33663,Italy,"Lush concentration and deep aromas of dark fruit and black cherry make an excellent first impression. This Dolcetto shows a dark, deep color and a chewy, almost inky texture.",88,20.0,Dolcetto
95521,US,"A very nice Chardonnay that has the dusty, herbal tug that Napa Chards often display. Otherwise it's very rich, with potent pineapple pie and peach tart flavors, enriched with creamy lees and buttery new oak. Drink now–2012.",92,70.0,Chardonnay
47927,Italy,"Lightweight and thin in the mouth, this zesty white wine does a good job of keeping your palate refreshed and quenches your thirst (think hot summer day). It's an easy and informal wine that stays focused on simplicity.",85,14.0,Pinot Grigio
73726,France,"Old vines have produced a superconcentrated and ripe wine. It has notes of toast, spice and yellow fruit as well as bright acidity. With its structure, depth of flavor and density, it should age well over 3–4 years.",92,35.0,Sauvignon Blanc
399,US,"The nose of this blend of 58% Syrah, 17% Cabernet Franc, 9% Merlot, 8% Malbec and 8% Petite Sirah is a touch funky, with sour blackberry, charcoal and dried meat aromas. Charred blueberry, sour black plum and savory meat flavors show on the palate.",86,32.0,Red Blend
95369,US,"A rush of zippy, fresh fruit and spice aromas recommends this white from New York, offering the kind of clean fruit flavors and minerality that makes this region unique. The wine lacks real complexity and tends toward the austere but the beguiling spice saves the day.",84,18.0,Chardonnay
87519,US,"Soft and sweetly fruity, with pie-filling flavors of blackberries, plums and cherries, spiced with anise and cinnamon. Easy to like. Drink now.",87,48.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
53359,US,"If you know the Rhône-style wines of Saxum, which is probably Paso Robles' most expensive wine, this is nearly identical. Mostly Syrah, with 8% Grenache, the wine is decadently rich in milk chocolate, blackberry jam and sweet, smoky oak flavors. It's very high in alcohol, but unless you're an extremist in this regard, you can't help but be knocked out by the wine's sensuous pleasures.",92,95.0,Rhône-style Red Blend
59054,US,"A bit on the soft, overripe side, with currant, licorice, cherry, cocoa and oak flavors. But it's dry, and the tannins are fancy. Drink it fresh out of the bottle with a grilled steak.",86,20.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
2327,US,"This beautiful wine further confirms the high level of quality in the Pinot Noirs from Dan Goldfield and Steve Dutton. It has a profusion of ripe black cherry and currant flavors, backed by firm acidity and fine-grained tannins, giving it grip. Its balance of concentrated fruit flavors and solid structure indicates a long life in the cellar. Best after 2020.",95,58.0,Pinot Noir
96499,US,"Very rich, with bounteous flavors of crushed ripe blackberries, blueberries, dill, black pepper and dark chocolate, with firm, furry tannins. A bit bitter now, and might age for a couple years.",85,48.0,Syrah
985,US,"Aromas of vanilla and wood spice lead to elegant, somewhat dried out and dilute fruit flavors, followed by a short finish.",85,27.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
491,US,"A collaboration between Sonoma County-based winemaker Jesse Katz and Ken Forrester of South Africa, this 100% varietal red is robust and rich. Dark cherry, red currant and integrated oak flavors support its bold body.",93,100.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
94915,US,"An extraordinarily rich Pinot, fat and opulent in cherry compote, mocha and root beer flavors. Generously oaked, it offers spicy oak notes and a velvety texture. It's a big, fruit-forward wine, but manages to maintain delicacy and harmony throughout. Best now through 2008.",92,48.0,Pinot Noir
79957,France,"Relatively tight and closed up at this stage, this wine is all about freshness, poised but rich fruit and a structure that suggests long-term development. The wood is quite prominent, overshadowing what will be delicious yellow-fruit flavors. Come back to this wine in 5 years time—it will be magnificent.",94,110.0,Chardonnay
66456,US,"This is a Pinot Noir-based blend, and it's quite a good dry, red wine of some sophistication and elegance. Soft and approachable, its cherry fruit flavors are complexed with herbs, such as sage and thyme, and a rich earthiness.",90,25.0,Red Blend
12273,US,"An easy drinking dinner wine, dry and balanced, with smooth tannins and plum, blackberry and coffee flavors. Has a rich, blueberry-muffin taste on the finish.",85,16.0,Merlot
78551,Italy,"Catches your eye with its brassy hue, and also makes its mark with an overtly sweet nose of peach blossom and melon. In the mouth, however, it struggles a bit, offering cider and melon flavors on a soft, rather punchless palate.",83,13.0,Grechetto
61983,Spain,"This is cool on the nose, with tree bark and tobacco aromas that come together well. Tannic and stout, it's not punishing, with a roasted black-fruit flavor and a backing of espresso bitterness. This shows a syrupy side and also raw power. Drink now–2018.",90,44.0,Tempranillo
73725,Italy,"A beautifully executed wine, this has fine aromas of cola, red currant, licorice, blue flower and moist earth. The texture is long, smooth, silky and elegant texture. There's a touch of menthol on the finish.",92,56.0,Nebbiolo
103820,US,"Still dependable despite changes in ownership, this winery again delivers an elegant, well-made wine. With this vintage, it veers more toward herbaceous notes than fruity ones. The dominant flavors are of green olives and sweet bell pepper. Don't think, however, that it's lean. Oak provides fatness, and the right foods, like grilled red meat, will coax out the berry sweetness.",87,22.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
43110,US,"Very, very sweet in residual sugar, with powerful flavors of apricots, honey, oranges and vanilla. A bit soft, but the luscious sweetness is what makes it work.",88,25.0,Chardonnay
22965,Spain,"Mild peachy aromas are friendly but nothing serious or intense. This varietal Macabeo feels citrusy, while lightly bitter flavors of almond skins, citrus pith and green melon finish with simplicity and a note of nectarine.",85,9.0,Macabeo
63684,France,"Ame means the spirit, the soul, and Alain Rotier believes this wine expresses the true nature of his Gaillac estate. On that basis, it's a place of great perfumes, coming through in the wine from wood as well as chunky black fruits. It is a relatively soft wine, the concentration in the dense fruit rather than the tannins.",91,40.0,Duras
64891,US,"This is bone dry, with plenty of acidity and tough tannins. It's not offering much relief, despite an evident core of blackberries, currants and cherries. Those tannins really lock the palate down, like a sandpaper straitjacket on the tongue. But you have to consider its origin in Yountville, a cool area noted for ageable wines. It hould begin to resolve its difficulties by 2016.",91,50.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
92418,Italy,"Packaged in a modern screwcap bottle, this friendly blend of Ribolla Gialla with smaller percentages of Friulano and Riesling delivers a bright golden color and lively fruit aromas of stone and passion fruits. The wine is crisp and lively in the mouth and perfectly captures the spirit of winemaking in Northeast Italy.",89,34.0,White Blend
83080,US,"A bit raw and rustic in texture, with a briary, green peppercorn mouthfeel that's scoury and tart in acids. Couple that with berry-cherry fruit, and you can a Zin that tastes sweet-and-sour. But it's very Zinny, and will wash down barbecue with ease.",84,28.0,Zinfandel
12533,US,"Will appeal broadly to many Pinot lovers for its soft, lush array of flavor. Raspberries, cherries, red currants, licorice and bacon all lead to a long, spicy finish. Trades complexity for immediate appeal, so drink up.",88,50.0,Pinot Noir
82398,US,"Too heavy and soft, like a melted mocha-raspberry sundae. Lacks structure, which makes it taste too sweet.",82,10.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
21177,US,"Birch Creek Vineyard provides the fruit for this stainless-steel-fermented and aged wine. It offers notes of custard, lees and herbs. The clover flavors show a richer feel but the concentration doesn't all seem to be there, trailing toward the finish.",87,36.0,Sémillon
78306,Italy,"Almost stewy but not totally over the top. The nose offers more earth and oak than brightness, while the palate is herb-infused, with berry and tomato. Fairly classic in style, but not as fresh as desirable.",84,20.0,Sangiovese
49852,US,"Very dry and a little earthy, with a dusty hay or dried straw quality to the tangerine, sweet lime, lychee, peaches and cream flavors. An interesting, crisp Chard with plenty of nuanced complexity.",91,30.0,Chardonnay
45825,US,"Smells and tastes ungenerous, probably due to unripe grapes that give an earthy, vegetal taste to the wine. Not going anywhere, so drink up.",83,24.0,Red Blend
92181,US,"Nice, rugged mountain Zin, with the briary, brambly tannins and peppery taste of wild berries freshly picked off the vine. Alcohol adds heat and structure, and time in the barrel has softened the tannins. This might just be the perfect backyard barbecue red wine.",86,16.0,Zinfandel
90711,France,"Moody, complex and brooding, this is a superb wine and an exceptional value. Purple violets, black forest cake, cocoa nibs and espresso granules all abound on the nose, backed by dark juicy black raspberries. Full and firmly structured in the mouth with notes of pepper, tea, smoked meat and black fruit on the palate.",93,28.0,Syrah
48761,Spain,"A real surprise! Who in their right mind could expect so much quality from a Cab Franc-Tempranillo blend from Penedès? But try it and we guarantee you're going to like it. The nose is meaty, ripe and round, while the palate features pure core fruit backed by chocolaty warmth. With kick as well as subtlety, this is a bargain hunter's dream. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",91,12.0,Red Blend
81433,US,"Another good job at a relatively inexpensive white variety from Clos du Bois. With Lake and Sonoma county grapes, the wine shows good Sauvignon Blanc character. Dry and crisp, it's savory in lemongrass, grapefruit and peach flavors that are lightly oaked.",86,14.0,Sauvignon Blanc
30123,US,"A touch of oak influence lends smokiness to the lime, Meyer lemon and tropical fruit flavors. With its crisp acidity that creates a sweet-and-sour taste, this wine is for drinking now as a cocktail sipper or with ham or Chinese food.",85,15.0,Sauvignon Blanc
40009,US,"A very tasty wine, loaded with fleshy, fruity flavor. The dominant note is fresh cut pear, dappled with cinnamon spice. Round and balanced, it's a delicious bottle with just a slight hint of residual sweetness.",88,16.0,Pinot Gris
93363,US,"Nice aromas of pie crust, red fruit and some barnyard lead to a tart, simple wine with watered-down flavors of red berry.",81,20.0,Cabernet Franc
51064,US,"This is a bold, densely structured wine with vanilla-cream, orange-soda and pineapple-custard flavors. There's good acidity, but it appeals to the modern style with it's ripe, straightforward feel.",85,25.0,Chardonnay

52998,US,"A pretty good Pinot Noir, dry and elegantly constructed, with crisp acidity and a backbone of tannins. The flavors of raspberry and cherry fruit are delicious, but the texture is scoury and a little warm, even though the alcohol is relatively low.",86,30.0,Pinot Noir

38074,Italy,"From young vintner Giovanni Abrigo in the Treiso area, this is a lovely expression of Barbaresco with immediate aromas of cherry, cassis, spice, smoke, leather and tobacco. The wine is approachable now, but it's also built to last: natural concentration, bright fruit flavors and acidity will hold ten years or more.",93,35.0,Nebbiolo
63785,Spain,"Rooty and earthy smelling, this has aromas of leather, cassis, tobacco, dried cheese and cola. It feels rich and nicely textured, with firm but friendly tannins that set up tobacco, coffee, mocha and roasted berry flavors. It's chocolaty in an uncanny way on the finish. Drink now through 2018.",93,70.0,Tempranillo
39074,Italy,"Without a doubt one of the most successful vineyard crus in Barbaresco, Rabajà delivers unique intensity and sophistication. You'll notice aromas of black fruit, spice, tar and licorice and there's good balance between the wine's acidity and its tannic structure. Pair this wine with roasted pork stuffed with prunes.",91,52.0,Nebbiolo
79426,France,"Michel Laroche has been branching out of Chablis in recent years and his southern French effort has some chlorine notes along with aromas of mint and sweet wood. The power is up there, but there isn't suppleness to match. The palate pulsates while the finish is dark and sharp, with a burnt flavor.",82,7.0,Merlot
17247,US,"Like almost all of Reverie's Cabernets on release, this one needs time in the cellar. Tasted in fall 2011, it's tight and grapey, with blackberry jam flavors girded by a firm, stony minerality and sweet, but hard, tannins. Give it 6–8 years.",92,75.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
55295,US,"This pure Mourvèdre begins well, offering a full palate of varietal flavors that are built upon a mix of citrus and ripe tree fruits, along with accents of leaf and forest. It turns soft and seems a bit overripe, running into a rather short finish.",87,35.0,Mourvèdre
87704,US,"Here's a bone-dry, crisply acidic and ultraclean Sauvignon Blanc. Its lemongrass, lime and grapefruit flavors are savory and bright, and accented with a cold streak of stony minerals.",87,20.0,Sauvignon Blanc

22441,Italy,"A sub-brand of Riunite, Albinea Canali's Ottocentonero shows simple, easy lines with raw fruit, cherry and almond paste. It's a dry Lambrusco without some of the bitterness you sometimes encounter with these wines.",84,13.0,Lambrusco
86040,US,"When this bottling is from a ripe vintage, it can be quite good. But the cool 2007 harvest has yielded a somewhat green wine. It has grapefruit and gooseberry flavors that veer into feline territory.",84,20.0,Sauvignon Blanc
2394,US,"The aromas of lemon, soil and flowers are quite subdued. The flavors are restrained with impressive balance and the variety's often burly tannins well tamed.",89,32.0,Petite Verdot
92591,US,"Coming from such a cool climate, this Cab isn't as opulent or ripe as, say, Napa. There's a wintergreen mint note alongside the sweet red cherry and black raspberry flavors, and a lightly elegant weight. It's a different kind of Cab, but a dry, good one, and very friendly with food.",87,35.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
44060,US,"Lots of ripe, jammy cherry, blackberry and chocolate fruit in this easy-drinking Cab. Shows some rusticity, though, in the raisiny finish and astringency of the tannins.",83,14.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
51598,Spain,"With aromas of milk-chocolate-covered cherries and forced oak, this smells overtly sweet and candied. This feels choppy and juicy, with red fruit flavors and buttery oak in the background. It turns sweeter and more buttery on the finish, but doesn't offer much complexity.",83,15.0,Grenache Blend
74895,Italy,"Sangiovese with 25% Merlot for added softness and dimension, this wine boasts pretty notes of cherry, blue flowers, toasted almonds and exotic spice. It has nice elegance overall but is a bit compact in the mouth.",87,15.0,Sangiovese
95897,Italy,"This luminous Pinot Grigio opens with simple aromas of stone fruit, melon and citrus and delivers fine levels of acidity and enough structure to carry forward with fish pasta or risotto. The wine performs nicely in the mouth thanks to its creamy texture.",86,20.0,Pinot Grigio
30098,US,"The most tannic and closed of Vine Cliff's magnificent array of '07 Cabernets. It's hard, with a bite of acidity, but it doesn't take much for the richness to explode. Blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate, butterscotch, sweet cinnamon spice, the list goes on and on. So rich and decadent, you can enjoy it now, but it will gather momentum over the next 6–8 years.",95,150.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
32989,Spain,"Mild salinic aromas bring lime and lychee. Feels standard and smooth enough, with sweet white fruit flavors that suggest peach. As a semi-dry, it always feels and tastes sugary.",84,9.0,Sparkling Blend
44466,Spain,"Fresh berry aromas carry some spice notes, while the palate is rugged and a little hot. Juicy berry flavors are forward but not overly evolved or complex, and the the finish is tight and aggressive. Spunky and clean, with honest flavors.",86,14.0,Tinto del Pais
49721,France,"With 14 months' new wood aging, this wine is still all wood and toast. The wine does have weight, with the promise of blackberry fruits under the firm tannins. It is finely structured and should mature well.",89,18.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
92379,US,"Erath's fresh and lightly fruity Pinot Gris is a bit more substantial than this new Pinot Blanc. Soft and fruity, this is a simple wine which does not challenge the palate in any way. All stainless steel fermented, it is the quintessential quaffer.",84,14.0,Pinot Blanc
53275,US,"Winemaker Denis Malbec has created a brilliantly delicious, crisp, dry yet richly textured version of the variety that opens with golden honey, dried apricot and lychee on the nose and mouth. Very minerally, the wine has a steely finish with smoky, oaky edges.",91,36.0,Sauvignon Blanc
19663,US,"A hearty Cabernet rich in cranberry and cassis with streaks of earthy cedar and a pleasant herbal undertone. The tannins are young still, pleading to wait until 2017–2019 in the bottle, or for some air before enjoying.",89,35.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
73278,US,"Curiously perfumed with notes of roasted hazelnuts and fresh apples, this is a savory, dry Chardonnay. Full bodied in style with notes of nut oil and nut skins throughout, it ends with a hint of wood sap astringency on the finish.",83,15.0,Chardonnay
18987,Italy,"Thanks to its dense clay soils, the Brunate cru delivers wines with high color saturation and aromatic caliber. This Barolo offers layers of black fruit, plum, spice, tobacco, cola and dark chocolate. The wine is firm and finely textured with power, dimension and personality on the long finish.",94,88.0,Nebbiolo
93934,Spain,"A wine searching for an identity. The nose deals menthol, licorice, grilled meat and molasses but little-to-no bright fruit. That heaviness transfers to the mouth, where marinated, baked flavors mix with green tomato. Fails to impress.",83,36.0,Tinto del Pais
34222,US,"A pale pink color introduces this wine, as do fairly weak aromas of bubble gum and freshly squeezed lime. This is one of three rosés made by Proulx, and they are all rather subtle in expression, this one delivering a bit of lime and decent amount of tannic grip to the palate. It would be a great match for anything rich in texture but light in flavor, as it could be easily overwhelmed.",86,24.0,Rosé
74042,France,"For any serious fan of Rivesaltes, this is a must-have example. Aromas of dried apricot, toasted hazelnut, fig, ginger, sweet spice and candied orange rind fill the bouquet, while the mouth is silky and balanced—sweet and heady without being cloying. All of the aromas transition onto the palate alongside accents of walnut skins and shiitake mushroom. Soft salinity makes the long finish even more mouthwatering. Drink now, or continue to age. There are 869 bottles produced.",95,350.0,Red Blend
23768,France,"Epineuil is a region between Burgundy and Chablis, producing light, fruity Pinot Noir. This perfumed and dusty wine does show some firm tannins. It is bright with red currant and raspberry fruits, with a fresh aftertaste.",87,23.0,Pinot Noir
75581,France,"This 12-year old shows signs of maturity, but retains freshness and liveliness as well. With its yeasty edge, toasty flavors and wonderful white fruits all in balance, it is finely balanced. The acidity is kept in check by the richness of the mature fruit. A very complete Champagne.",94,95.0,Chardonnay
95624,US,"You sure can taste the sunny, fruity extract in this wine. It's massive in black cherry liqueur, cassis and mocha-choca flavors. It's also very soft, with a long, almost sweet finish.",85,29.0,Zinfandel
47575,US,"and sweet, with candied cherry, raspberry and carob flavors. Tasty enough, but seriously lacks the acidity to make this fruity wine come alive. From Cartlidge & Browne.",83,35.0,Pinot Noir
91923,France,"Just like the '07, this is a blend of 60% Grenache Bl;anc, 20% Marsanne and 20% Roussanne, featuring ripe melon and peach fruit wrapped around an underlying minerality. It's full and broad, yet manages to be refreshing despite its weightiness.",87,12.0,White Blend
93529,France,"An intensely mineral expression of Sauvignon Blanc, crisp, full of citrus flavors, deliciously fresh, but also complex. The wine is concentrated into a steel spring of ripeness, ready to burst from the glass.",92,22.0,Sauvignon Blanc
53814,France,"This is grandiose, with ripe apricot and peach flavors—even a note of mango—that are allied to the wood notes. As a contrast, there is fine acidity and elegance, with a lemon zest edge that gives structure to this full, superripe, powerful effort.",93,125.0,Chardonnay
14185,Italy,"This hearty red wine from central Italy would pair well with grilled meat or veal wrapped in sage leaves and sliced prosciutto ham. Loads of red berries are followed by notes of exotic spice, leather, tobacco and firm tannins. Drink in 3–5 more years.",91,22.0,Red Blend
62174,US,"From Dijon clones, this sculpted, tight, compact Chardonnay feels as if it is shut in a cocoon. Give it time (and decanting) to unwrap, and it shows elegant tropical and stone fruits, caramel, vanilla cream and butter flavors, backed with moderate acids.",88,28.0,Chardonnay
81790,US,"This debut blend somehow reaches 15% alcohol, not easy to do with Yakima Valley Sangiovese. It's a solid effort, which opens well—supple and polished, with pretty flavors of mixed plum and berry. It's silky, smooth and there's plenty of tangy fruit. The finish gets a little too hot, but that's a minor quibble in a wine that gives you this much flavor at this price. The finish keeps getting more and more interesting, piling on smoked ham and spicy clove as it goes.",90,20.0,Red Blend
37199,US,"Texture is the name of the game here. We're talking pure velvet, the way the wine glides over the palate with hardly a wrinkle. Beyond the mouthfeel are flavors so complex, they're hard to describe. The blend consists of Cabernet Sauvignon, with contributions from Cab Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot, and each grape brings its own distinction, as does 100% new oak. It's approachable now for the softness, and should glide through the next 6–8 years with ease. Expensive, yes, and only 344 cases were produced, but it's worth the search.",95,90.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
18596,Italy,"This is a terrific value wine (a rosé made from the indigenous grapes of Sicily) that opens with a bright pink color and fragrant tones of raspberry, white almond and rose petal.",86,13.0,Rosé
65581,US,"Less immediately accessible than the 2005, the 2006 is tight and tart and almost seems encased in some sort of a shell. The fruit is concentrated raspberry and plum, and the acids taste natural while the tannins are polished and proportionate. The wine stays focused and strong through a very long finish that dapples in toasted coconut and chocolate malt. If you are a Rollat collector (and you should be) this would be the wine to cellar for five or six years, waiting for the Edouard to come into full flower.",92,45.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
76243,US,"Light strawberry, raspberry and Bing cherry fruit, medium weight, straight-ahead, nicely ripened. The tannins are soft and the balance works just fine.",87,32.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
36794,Spain,"The year 2007 is not going to go down in the books as a good one for Ribera del Duero. Many of the young wines, like this one, are showing narrow, sour fruit and too much funk and pickle. Here, there's a touch of jamminess and red fruit but mostly it's another thin, pushy wine with anemic flavors and a rough mouthfeel. Stick with the 2006 if you can find it.",83,20.0,Tempranillo Blend
19554,US,"Some years ago, Willamette Valley Vineyards purchased the Tualatin Estate vineyards and winery founded by Bill Fuller in 1973.

Potent and focused, it carries those flavors into a finish rich with bee pollen and preserved lemon intensity.",91,35.0,Chardonnay
60440,Italy,"Fattoria Scopone's 2004 Riserva opens with charred aromas of campfire, liquid smoke and barbecue sauce.

100673,Italy,"Lean, sharp and herbal, this is a true apéritif wine that whets the appetite. A slight sour-cream note on the palate is offset by a tangy citrus-laden finish that blends in some cinnamon-spiced pear flavors.",84,19.0,Cortese

80057,Italy,"Morellino di Scansano is known in Italy as an informal, fruit-forward wine that washes down beautifully with heaping plates of pasta and home cooked meals. This expression follows squarely in that tradition and offers perky aromas of cherry cola, spice, blackberry and dried Mediterranean herbs.",87,25.0,Sangiovese

69173,US,"The winery identifies this as “the best barrels from our best lots.” Supple and streaked with chocolate and caramel, this explosion of cherry, cassis, cola and Dr. Pepper contains sneaky notes of tobacco and pepper threaded through the lingering finish. Richness and depth prevail throughout.",93,55.0,Pinot Noir
11727,US,"I have seldom tasted a Dry Creek Valley Cabernet (the appellation, not the winery) that didn't have a woolly edge to it. This wine is an excellent example.

92684,US,"Massive, opulent, oozing in pineapple créme brulée, honey, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors. Totally decadent, and fortunately set off with brisk, citrusy acidity. Calling all lobsters, and don't forget the drawn butter. Sheer hedonism in a glass, at a fantastic price.",95,26.0,Chardonnay
86896,US,"Light berry fruit, alcohol around 13%, a pale color, and plenty of acidity characterize this Pinot Noir. Still tightly wound, it may add some flesh with further bottle age. The aromas hint at tomato leaf, and the wine fades gently.",87,30.0,Pinot Noir
8309,US,"Another successful 2011 from this winery, in fact the best of their six new Pinots. Shows the brilliant acidity and light, delicate texture of the coast, with the concentrated fruit, cola and spice flavors this esteemed vineyard is noted for. Highly complex and dry, it's delicious to drink now, and should age well for a good six years.",94,54.0,Pinot Noir

46469,Italy,"Here's a winery founded at the start of the 1900s that has morphed over the decades to enthusiastically embrace modern use of oak.

Drink now through 2016. Only 250 cases made.",91,80.0,Tempranillo
92575,US,"Ouch. Tough, extremely dry, and acidic-tannic, this wine isn't showing much charm now. There's a suggestion of blackberry, bitter cherry and blueberry fruit, as well as lots of smoky oak. Nowhere near ready, and hard to predict. Try after 2008.",84,26.0,Petite Sirah

40114,US,"Made from 100% Cabernet, this wine is very extracted and jammy, in the modern style of extreme ripeness and fruit-forwardness. Sweet oak, 70% of it new, adds layers of cream, vanilla and buttered toast. Appeals now for its juicy, New World style.",90,85.0,Cabernet Sauvignon

99379,US,"This is a young, tight wine. It stuns with strong acidity and a bitter lime zest, almost gooseberry tartness.

61432,US,"Great price for a brut this classically structured. Made from Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, it's dry and crisp, with a fine mousse that gives it a creamy smooth mouthfeel. The pineapple, raspberry and vanilla flavors are delicious.",90,19.0,Champagne Blend
2357,Italy,"Reflecting the heat of the vintage, aromas recall stewed prune, fig and toasted oak. The hearty but one-dimensional palate delivers dried berry, roasted coffee bean, vanilla and anisette alongside raspy, mouth-puckering tannins. Searing alcohol dominates the finish.",86,100.0,Sangiovese
72384,Italy,"Really charming, with a nose of green plums, red berries and earth that jumps out of the glass and curls up in your lap. The palate is lacking a bit in intensity but makes up for it with iresistable cassis flavor followed by fresh-roasted coffee. The bracing acidity would be well matched by a cheese-laden dish such as lasagna. Drink now to one year.",86,9.0,Dolcetto
67930,France,"Moderately intense menthol, black licorice and African violets aromas on the nose. The mouth, full of ripe plum and dark cherries accented by notes of cocoa and fresh mint leaves, has a lovely balance and silky texture. Ends on a somewhat simple yet clean finish.",88,11.0,Rhône-style Red Blend
13732,US,"Made in a softly appealing style, this Pinot is like cherry pie sprinkled with brown sugar and cinnamon. It shows Pinot Noir's silky texture.",85,21.0,Pinot Noir
96478,US,"Without showing the richness of prior vintages, this year's bottling is earthy and crisp and very dry. It has a steely minerality and modest fruit that suggests green apples and pineapples.",85,40.0,Chardonnay
82546,US,"A bit vegetal, and a bit sweet on the finish in pineapple candy. Not particularly successful.",82,20.0,Chardonnay
42540,US,"Starts out very light in mouthfeel, almost delicately simple, with such a dry, wispy texture that it feels almost inconsequential. Then you notice the flavors of cola, tart cherryskin, ripe rhubarb, coffee, Asian spices and caramelized oak. They mingle together in a complex swirl that makes you want another sip.",89,30.0,Pinot Noir
86472,US,"Pungent and grapey, with notes of violets and dusty chocolate. The astringent fruit shows varietal cassis flavor, somewhat overtaken by the extremely charred, coffee ground flavors of the finish.",86,32.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
36947,US,"This Pinot opens with aromas of strawberry, cherry and flowers, leading into juicy berry flavors and a touch of balsamic, pepper and strawberry. Good structure and a lingering finish give it added appeal.",86,16.0,Pinot Noir
40493,US,"Greenwood Ridge often does a good job at Sauvignon Blanc, but not this year. The wine is irritating in unripe feline flavors and it's also off-dry, with 1.9% residual sugar.",80,18.0,Sauvignon Blanc
99788,US,"Size marks this wine. It's huge in flavor, swamping the palate with black and red cherries, pomegranates, sweet rhubarb pie, coffee and vanilla. At the same time, it's fairly light in color, and certainly light and silky in body, with crisp acids. Shows enough complexity to serve with your finest entrées.",90,35.0,Pinot Noir
90955,Italy,"This is a pleasant red wine from Piedmont in northern Italy made with Nebbiolo and Vespolina grapes for a clean delivery of berry, spice and cola aromas. The wine is tonic and fresh in the mouth with clean acidity and playful bite of exotic spice on the close.",88,40.0,Red Blend
26791,US,"Hard to keep from falling in love with this wine. It's so luscious in bright, spicy wild cherry, raspberry and root beer flavors. With a satiny texture and brilliant acidity, it's stunningly drinkable now, but should hold and develop over the next six years.",94,36.0,Pinot Noir
8051,US,"Massively rich and ripe with blackberry jam, chocolate, anise and spice flavors, this Zin doesn't leave much to the imagination. You can taste the California sunshine and heat in every potent sip. The alcohol is very high, yet the wine wears it well. Drink now.",86,36.0,Zinfandel
96754,Italy,"Cometa boasts a brilliant, saturated golden color and carries through with clean execution in terms of aromas and flavors. Notes of tropical fruit and ripe citrus come into sharp focus thanks to Fiano's natural minerality. In the mouth, it offers plenty of weight, but balances that with great length on the finish, hinting at anise, honey, limes and oranges.",91,39.0,Fiano
98254,US,"From down in Paso comes this soft, chocolaty Merlot. Acidity is deficient, but this kind of flavor goes a long way to saving the wine, which has the taste of perfectly ripe, crushed blackberries.",84,15.0,Merlot
63754,US,"This tastes and feels a little gritty, with dry tannins. There's something old-fashioned about it, in an era of lush, sweet Cabernetss that appeal in their youth. A rich core of blackberry and black currant suggests that time in the cellar will be rewarded. Hold until 2017 or so.",88,52.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
79656,US,"Opens with a nice nose of roasted nuts, banana, caramel and a hint of smoke. The palate's pear, baked apple and apricot flavors wear interesting coconut accents, but all these are unfortunately overrun by a scotch notes peek out from behind an edgy acidity.",85,55.0,Chardonnay
55340,US,"A light style, but still stylish, with finesse and good structure. The pretty plum fruit is lightly dusted with cocoa, softening the tannins and adding spice to the finish. A gentle and beguiling wine, ready for near-term enjoyment.",88,19.0,Pinot Noir
103829,US,"Aromas of sun-dried tomatoes, coffee, cinnamon, toast, blackberries and currants introduce a wine that drinks light and fruity. Some pretty flavors here, with lots of spice and soft tannins. Nothing to write home about, but nice enough for a dry red table wine.",85,21.0,Merlot
92603,Spain,"Light raspberry along with charred wood carries the modest nose. Additional raspberry flavors blend with sweeter strawberry tastes to create a mildly creamy, easygoing palate. Finishes fairly buttery, with toast and popcorn notes. An attempt at a major-league wine that is semi-successful.",87,28.0,Tempranillo Blend
56140,US,"One of two Tempranillos from Fenestra (the other from Lodi), the Livermore Valley version is bright, tasting of cherry spice, with good acidity. Nearing the finish the taste turns to toasty dark molasses; a nice wine overall.",87,36.0,Tempranillo
24368,France,There is a rosé here struggling to get out. This wine has strawberry fruits combined with tannins in a way that does not work. Bordeaux Clairet lies between rosé and red in color and in taste.,83,14.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
55592,Italy,"A bold blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah, this opens with soft and luscious fruit tones of cherry and blackberry jam. Leather and tobacco add a savory, masculine quality, and there's a tart red-fruit flavor that adds a touch of refreshing acidity.",92,56.0,Red Blend
47730,US,"Tart acidity marks this dry wine, interfering with the palate pleasure and causing some imbalance. Otherwise, it shows a tension of cool-climate raspberry and cherry ripeness with a touch of wintergreen mint. Give it more richness, and it's a great wine.",87,32.0,Pinot Noir
50635,Italy,"This has bell pepper and red currant aromas along with obvious oak and vanilla sensations, all of which carry over to the palate alongside a forward espresso note. A bit shy on vibrancy, it's also tightly tannic and demonstrates the heat of the vintage.",87,35.0,Red Blend
12682,US,"A mix of fruit that survived the big freeze, from Dwelley, Morrison Lane and Minnick vineyards. It's tight, tart and tannic, and showing some pickle barrel notes from time in new American oak. Herbal and compact, this is a wine that should probably be given another year or so in the bottle to smooth itself out.",87,25.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
91608,US,"The appellation is near the western, cooler part of Paso Robles, and the wine's rich chocolate fudge and creamy cherry and cassis flavors have the requisite acidity and tannins needed to temper them. Almost sweet on the finish, the wine redeems itself with elegance. The high alcohol isn't really a problem, in terms of balance.",88,26.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
15113,Italy,"Aged in large oak casks, this dark and thickly extracted Ripasso does a nice job of integrating mature black fruit aromas with spice and tobacco. The oak element is nicely tucked in the background and the wine shows bright fruit flavors in the mouth as well.",89,18.0,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
72113,US,"This is way too soft and unstructured, especially at this price. It's a sweet, syrupy wine, with blackberry jam and cocoa flavors, and it's also high in alcohol.",82,56.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
67389,US,"Oak dominates this wine, withstrong notes of buttered toast, vanilla and sweet char. There's nothing wrong with those pleasant aromas and flavors, but the underlying wine, with its cherry and currant fruit, is overpowered by the wood.",85,20.0,Petite Sirah
57243,US,"Made from DuBrul Vineyard fruit, this has lush strawberry and raspberry flavors that dig deep into the core, supported by a base of minerality. The tightly-focused finish includes echoes of toasty barrel-derived flavors.",90,72.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
14982,US,"A mellow, well-rounded Petite that could almost be mistaken for blueberry tea, so prominent are those two strains of flavor in this wine.",86,27.0,Petite Sirah
44904,US,"A very fruity, extracted Zin, with jammy raspberry and cherry flavors that finish with a bite of acidity. Clean and easy to drink, it's a nice sipper with summer barbecue.",85,28.0,Zinfandel
20727,US,"Woody, brambly notes lend an earthy complexity to fresh blackberry and cassis notes on this bright, brisk Merlot. A shower of cranberry acidity jolts the palate and cuts through the fine, but penetrating tannins that fringe the finish. An elegant, refreshing example of a cool-climate Merlot.",88,20.0,Merlot
655,US,"From 100% estate-grown grapes, and possessing 6.8 g/L of residual sugar, this wine is lovely in peach, pear and lemon, and quite voluptuous in texture, with a hint of spice. Pretty floral aromas of jasmine provide additional flourish and invitation, with the finish dry.",90,25.0,Riesling
81834,US,"Here's an intense, nervy young Cab that impresses for its powerful oak and cassis flavors. It's a little sharp now, with an acidic jamminess and tea-like tannic structure that suggests moderate aging capability. Stash it until 2008, then open for a couple of years.",88,35.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
88693,France,"Firm, solid, chunky, a great success from a château that is currently in top form, even in more difficult years. The bright fruits charge through the tannins, giving some richness, balancing with the elegance and freshness of the year. Worth aging.",93,50.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
29835,Spain,"Bright and aggressive for Llopart, with lively orange and apricot aromas. Frothy to the point of being bubbly, with ripe, bouncy pink grapefruit and other citrus flavors. Stays racy and citrusy on the finish. All fruit; not complex.",88,22.0,Sparkling Blend
40864,Spain,"Starts out sharp and funky, and then quickly you realize that it's showing signs of age. The wine blends sweet and sour notes on both the bouquet and palate, issuing primary grapefruit flavors and some mustard greens on the finish. But the feel is chunky and it's losing its zest day by the day.",86,15.0,Verdejo
63285,US,"With just 2% Syrah, this is a Bordeaux-style blend, feauturing mostly Cabernet and Merlot. The rich entry features berry, chocolate and espresso, with a round midpalate and polished tannins. A hint of tar runs through the finish.",88,29.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
20209,Italy,"Blue-flower and red-berry aromas lead the way along with a whiff of eucalyptus. The firm palate offers hints of star anise, espresso and a green note of powdered sage that back up unripe red cherry. It closes on a coffee note.",87,29.0,Red Blend
2579,France,"Layered botrytis that gives the wine both its richness and dense texture. It is sweet but with a dry core and crisp acidity, it will age well. It is going to be a beautiful wine, with tropical fruits, apricots and wonderful final acidity. Drink from 2025.",94,50.0,Bordeaux-style White Blend
39870,US,"Peachy Canyon's least expensive wine is a soft, simple, and rather sweet with candied raspberry and cherry flavors.",82,12.0,Zinfandel
49767,US,"Lush, thick and chewy, with rich purple and black fruits, pepper and a finish of vanilla cream. The tannins are substantial but not intrusive; they carry a sensation of rock and graphite. Flavors extend themselves gracefully; the ripe fruit remains front and center, but it finishes with plenty of nuanced rock and spice and hints of herb. An exceptional effort.",92,28.0,Syrah
1718,France,"Perfumed fruits offer a ripe counterpoint to the solid tannins. Dark cherries, a touch of wood and layers of acidity come together well, leaving the chance to age further. Drink until 2020.",90,23.0,Gamay
56560,Spain,"This needs air to show its best, because at first it's tight, mulchy and nutty. Early on, it feels clampy and scratchy, but it becomes better as it airs. The black fruit flavors are touched up by notes of oak, dried cheese and leather—characteristics that extend onto the finish.",89,62.0,Tempranillo
48031,US,"A very nice buy at this price. Dry and jammy, the wine features ripe flavors of blackberries, cherries, anise, cocoa and mint, with smoky, oaky notes and mouthwateringly crisp coastal acidity.",85,10.0,Syrah
74140,France,"Obviously not in the first flush of youth, this dry rosé goes more for mature almond marzipan along with cranberry juice flavors to give some tightness to the texture. Definitely to be drunk now. Screwcap.",84,14.0,Cabernet Franc
70733,US,"The winery's most popular wine, Cali is 49% Cabernet Sauvignon, 47% Merlot and 4% Sangiovese. Nice aromatics lead into a medium-bodied wine with bright spices, strawberry preserves, some sour plum, and defining acidity, with a lick of chocolate in the finish.",87,17.0,Red Blend
42927,Italy,"This cheerful Rosso di Montalcino offers a distinctively oak-driven bouquet of smoke, spice and mesquite followed by a bright ensemble of berry fruit aromas. The wine is soft and slightly sweet on the finish with a burst of cherry and blueberry at the close.",89,30.0,Sangiovese Grosso

11758,Spain,"Harmonious on the bouquet, this has aromas of berry, marzipan and nutmeg. It feels a little acidic but that adds freshness to the package. The flavors of earthy, roasted fruits are a touch salty, and the finish tastes briney and baked, with notes of coffee and toast. A blend of 65% Tempranillo, 20% Merlot and 15% Caberent Sauvignon.",88,24.0,Red Blend
17394,US,"Amazingly delicious and soft. Defines the modern Napa Cabernet style, with the tasteful elegance Hall wines are known for.

77640,Italy,"Here's a simple, no-fuss Prosecco Extra Dry with an interesting herbal component that recalls dried oregano or hay. There's peach and citrus fruit at the back that is carried forward by spicy effervescence. The mouthfeel is thin and tonic.",84,12.0,Prosecco
38876,Spain,"Seems sort of waxy and baked, with mildly acrid aromas of burnt corn leading the way. The palate has an o.k. feel but the flavors are rather bitter and burnt, and the fruit isn't pointed or expressive. May already be past its prime. Imported by Winery Exchange.",83,9.0,Verdejo
102014,US,"Dark, thick with tannins, a sturdy wine with plenty of fleshy blackberry and coffee flavors. Bone dry, and can probably age for a few years.",85,20.0,Syrah
24799,US,"Sourced from old-vine Wädenswil clones, this effort carries the new Elkton AVA designation. Pretty raspberry and strawberry fruit is set in lightly toasty tannins. This is a lovely everyday Pinot Noir with some density.",88,23.0,Pinot Noir
45574,Spain,"Prieto Picudo is a variety unknown to most wine drinkers. And that's probably a good thing, because the grape yields acidic, tight, astringent wines like this. Yes, there's color and size here, but there's not much balance or charm.",80,20.0,Prieto Picudo
46239,US,"Very ripe, almost raisiny, with a cooked fruit flavor, although the wine is fully dry. The tannins are on the harsh side, and the stewed character seems to accentuate the acidity. Drink now.",82,18.0,Zinfandel
21362,US,"A blend of Viognier (60%), Roussanne (25%) and Marsanne, this wine is moderately aromatic with notes of pear, melon, apricot and flowers. It's medium bodied with abundant stone fruit flavors, quite reserved considering the warmth of the vintage.",90,28.0,Rhône-style White Blend
62371,Italy,"Here's a fresh and bright rosé from Central Italy with a delicate bouquet of wild flowers and forest berry. The wine is luminous, pristine and would pair with appetizers or light summer pasta or chicken curry salad. In the mouth, the wine tastes fresh, crisp and clean.",87,12.0,Rosé
45034,US,"A bit tough and sharp, but not a bad Cabernet. It has deep flavors of blackberries, currants, cola, anise and cedar, and is bone dry. You can bet there's some declassified high-end wine in this blend.",85,20.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
36423,Italy,"Bright, brambly berry and forest floor notes open this bouquet of this 80-20 Nergroamaro and Malvasia Nera blend. Touches of cherry and sun-ripened prune also make an appearance, especially on the finish.",87,15.0,Red Blend
101608,US,"Kind of overripe in raisins and prunes, which detracts for me, but it's dry, with a chocolate and cassis finish that flatters the palate. The tannins are soft and sweet.",86,30.0,Zinfandel
102563,US,"Future vintages of this wine will bear the new Red Mountain appellation, for that is where Klipsun is located. Waterbrook does the grapes proud: This is a juicy, ripe white wine bursting with scents and flavors of fresh fruits, cut grass, light spice and even some toasted coconut in the extended finish. Best Buy.",90,8.0,Sauvignon Blanc
83478,Spain,"Nothing special about this blend of Tempranillo and Shiraz. In fact, it's more austere and less pleasing than the brand's basic 2007 Temp-Shiraz blend. That said, this wine shows thin raspberry flavors and a tangy, almost sour back end. Probably best with food; not real good on its own.",83,12.0,Tempranillo-Shiraz
78174,France,"Robust, full and nicely structured with good acidity and medium tannins, this red offers up loads of jammy raspberry and blueberry with accents of carnation and mocha. Pepper and spice appear on the mouth and follow through the long, evolving finish.",87,20.0,Rhône-style Red Blend
101484,Italy,"Gold in color, with a ton of oak. But you know what? It works. The resin and vanilla aromas over time become attractive, while the rich palate deals coconut, toffee and baked white fruits. Yes, it's a barrique bomber from a hot climate, but it's interesting and should go well with roast fowl or foie gras.",87,27.0,Chardonnay
17877,France,"Vibrant and lively red fruit aromas blend with fragrant woody spice in the bouquet. The cherry and berry flavors transition to the palate, where somewhat gripping tannins coupled with notes of fudgy brownie and black pepper add depth to the finish.",89,10.0,Rhône-style Red Blend
59282,US,"A sweet style of sparkling wine, with brisk acidity framing orange, lime, vanilla and honey flavors. Nice with wedding cake, at a good price.",86,11.0,Sparkling Blend
19242,US,"A terrific mouthfeel highlights this mix of berry and cherry fruits, toast and cinnamon. Tart and focused, it was aged in roughly half new French oak for the first 10 months, then transferred to neutral barrels for another five months. Fine-grained tannins give it an elegant finish.",93,85.0,Pinot Noir
15194,Italy,"Crisp, light and redolent of red apple and forest berry, this wine should pair with fried chicken or easy pasta dishes. There's a sharp bitter berry note on the close.",84,10.0,Montepulciano
75543,US,"This appellation, on the west side of Salinas Valley just below Santa Lucia Highlands, is great for whites. Reds fare less well, especially when the vines are overcropped, as they seem to have been with this thin, acidic Merlot. It shows candied flavors of cherries and mint.",82,12.0,Merlot
93072,US,"Pretty good Cab for the price, a little soft, but ripe enough, with upfront blackberry and cherry flavors and that chocolate fudge note that marks so many modern Cabs. It's a pleasantly dry wine with some real complexity.",85,18.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
44567,US,"The fruit comes from two great Yakima Valley vineyards, Boushey and Elerding, and although the alcohol pins the meter at 15.3% it holds together with pretty cherry fruit, plenty of acid and tannin to provide the backbone. 266 cases produced.",88,18.0,Sangiovese
2797,US,"The term Vintner's Select, which is unregulated, can be abused. Here it really means something, as this is the winery's top cuvée—an excellent effort that spent 18 months in oak. There's extra depth in the cherry and cassis fruit, packing a powerful, compact punch all the way through a long, polished finish.",94,65.0,Pinot Noir

99703,US,"This has some real strength to the fruit, which shows depth, nerve and muscle. There's a nice high note suggesting citrus, even grapefruit; below that some racy berry fruit flavors; then comes the impact of tannin and espresso. It all adds up to some real excitement in the mouth. A powerful wine that zings the palate and leaves you wanting more.",91,39.0,Meritage
22956,Spain,"Briny citrus, feline notes and pithy scents send this Merseguera-led blend toward a pulpy, citrusy palate. Grapefruit and pithy, lightly bitter flavors finish citric, with little change from the wine's primary flavors.",85,9.0,White Blend

2660,US,"This wine features tempting clove, black cherry and pomegranate flavors. It has great balance, an easygoing texture and a clean, fruity finish. It's medium to full bodied, but the oaky flavors and tannins stay well within bounds.",89,14.0,Syrah
89381,US,"Rich in cherry, blackberry, raspberry and herb flavors, this Rhône blend has sweet-and-sour berry-cherry flavors. It's rich in dry, furry tannins. Needs something big and meaty to soften it, like beef stew.",84,11.0,Red Blend
49992,US,"In 2003 the vineyard was going through some changes, and the vintage, the shift in focus and the winemaker's predilection for early picking seemed to conspire to produce a rather thin, austere wine. It's locked up tight, a bit herbal and lean, not yet revealing itself even with aeration. It's one of those mystery wines that you keep coming back to, waiting for the light to blink on.",88,30.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
44670,US,"Fragrant and ripe, this brightly colored cab franc mixes flavors of pomegranate, red currant, spicy cherry and red apple. Forward and nicely fruity, it leaves out the new oak and finishes clean and crisp.",88,18.0,Cabernet Franc
80126,US,"Tons of flavor in this ripe, juicy wine, which comes from Napa, Monterey and Lodi, an interesting combination of cool and warm climates. Bursting with cherries, blackberries, red licorice, cola, cocoa, dates and vanilla spice, the wine also is balanced.",86,12.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
51511,Italy,"Terre di Giumara is a line of value wines. This Nero d'Avola offers bright aromas of berry, cassis, fennel, moist earth and almond that recall the natural fragrances of Sicily. The wine is simple, fresh and clean on the close.",87,12.0,Nero d'Avola

53340,US,"Packaged in an unusual plastic-style recyclable bag, with a seal you have to figure out how to open, this is a fine Sauvignon Blanc.

The wine renders a sweet, chewy sensation in the mouth with soft texture and a creamy finish.",84,11.0,White Blend
14727,US,"Though varietally labeled, this intriguing white Rhône includes 12% each Marsanne and Grenache Blanc.

80191,US,"This is blended from two finished wines: a 2005 Counoise (64%) and a 2006 Viognier (36%). It's ripe and round and showing strawberry and peach flavors. The two grapes work together well, and create a seamless wine with plenty of fruit power.",86,18.0,Rosé

86625,US,"Soft, ripe and decadent, this Pinot, from the Napa side of Carneros, brims with blackberry, cherry, cola, vanilla, licorice and cinnamon spice flavors. It's full-bodied, but has Pinot's elegant silkiness. At its best now and for a couple years.",87,40.0,Pinot Noir
32939,US,"Lots of delicious raspberry and cherry flavors in this spicy wine, but it's just too sweet. That's probably a combination of residual sugar and extraordinarily high alcohol of 16.5%, which makes it almost Port-like.",87,35.0,Zinfandel
66675,US,"Cabernet Franc has been the signature wine for Barrister since the first release in 2001. Once again it comes out dark and smoky in the house style, but with more spine and muscle than the Barrister Merlot.

40143,US,"Wow—delicious, the best yet. Lots of pineapple from the 75% Celilo fruit, very crisp and lightly butterscotchy. Big but not heavy, with alcohol in the mid-13% range.

86398,US,"As comfortable as an old shoe, the Grand Estates Chardonnay from Columbia Crest delivers broad, open flavors of buttered fruit – almost like biting into a slice of apple pie, crust and all. Hard to argue with it, all 160,000 cases strong.",86,11.0,Chardonnay
2542,Italy,"Juicy and round, this opens with scents of honeysuckle, yellow stone fruit and a hint of aromatic herb. The full-bodied palate offers ripe white peach, pear and a hint of candied lemon drop while a mineral note backs up the finish.",89,21.0,Fiano
35676,France,"This, the second wine from Clos de la Maréchale, is light, very fresh, dusty in texture, the tannins held in suspension, with red plum and cranberry flavors.",87,47.0,Pinot Noir
42233,US,"Pretty dark and full-bodied for a rosé, and too extracted and heavy in cherry-berry flavors to be considered elegant. It's almost a red wine you could drink at room temperature.",82,10.0,Rosé
20091,France,"This tight, taut and crisp wine needs some time to bring out its true fruity character. Behind the texture, ripe green plums and fresh apples are cut with lime juice. The wine is still young and could benefit from a few more months. Drink from late 2015.",89,18.0,Melon
32020,Italy,"Aromas of brandied cherry, crushed violet black pepper and a whiff of exotic spice lead the way. The round palate doles out dried plum, raisin, nutmeg, vanilla and a confectionary note alongside velvety tannins. Drink 2016–2021.",90,60.0,Red Blend
34499,US,"This starts light, with wild berry and bramble flavors, but it's nicely balanced and persists across the palate with pleasant milk chocolate flavors. Well integrated with good acids, this 100% varietal Merlot is pleasurable and easy drinking.",88,22.0,Merlot
41861,US,"Give this fresh young Pinot a year to mellow. Right now, it's jammy in raspberries and cherries, with a citric sharpness. Needs brief time to knit together and become seamless.",87,35.0,Pinot Noir
46159,US,"An exquisite wine that combines delicacy and harmony with enormously fruity-spicy flavors that fill the mouth. The aromas suggest candied ginger, tropical fruits, vanilla and wildflowers. The flavors are effusively fruity and on the dry side, with refreshingly crisp acidity. Try it with Asian-Pacific fusion foods.",87,12.0,Gewürztraminer
87942,US,"Great price for this unoaked white wine. It's smooth and crisp in mouthwatering acidity, with ripe flavors of citrus fruits, lemongrass, minerals and vanilla that finish with a honeyed richness. Easy to find, with production of 21,696 cases.",87,12.0,Fumé Blanc
95469,France,"A pure strawberry jam wine, its ripe fruit scintillating with freshness and acidity. The wine is also round, with tannins giving some weight. The aftertaste is deliciously fruity.",89,17.0,Gamay
45872,Italy,"La Giaretta is an up-and-coming winery in full evolution with a modern approach and excellent pricing. There are deep oak aromas here that thankfully do not overwhelm delicate notes of cherry cola, cough drop, Indian spice, herbal infusion and almond. This is a spice-driven wine with a velvety texture and lively fruit on the finish.",91,23.0,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
80564,Spain,"Warm and smelling of menthol, cough syrup and sweet, jammy berry fruit. The palate is also fairly medicinal in terms of flavor, while the feel is a bit hard and underdeveloped. Turns more tart and herbal the more you get to know it.",83,14.0,Tempranillo
11720,US,"Luscious, long, full-bodied and rich, a wonderful wine that showcases its appellation. Has well-ripened flavors of blackcurrants and cassis that drink long and deep, although there's some hollowness, which costs it a few points. The flavors are wrapped in soft, easy but complex tannins. Fully dry and nicely oaked, this wine is immediately enjoyable.",90,35.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
67413,Spain,"Aromas of barrel spice and grilled pineapple are solid, while the palate is thick and creamy with orange marmalade and banana flavors. If you like a thick, unctuous Chard with a glob of oak, this is it. Has its strong points but tastes too much like cinnamon stick and wood. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",84,24.0,Chardonnay
98859,US,"Impresses for the sheer volume of the fruit. Flamboyant tropical pineapple, mango, guava, lots of dusty spices, rich oak, but manages to hold onto balance, dryness and even a sense of finesse all the way through the long finish.",92,39.0,Chardonnay
27869,US,"Sweet meets earthy, with aromas that recall grilled beets, cola and sassafras. The bottling comes from the father-son team of Tondré and Joe Alarid, who planted their vineyard in 1997 and combined have nearly a century's worth of farming experience in the Salinas Valley. Homemade cranberry sauce wins the palate, and the wine has more tannins than most Pinot Noirs of similar age. Enjoy now or cellar until 2016 for even more emerging flavors.",91,40.0,Pinot Noir
92451,US,"The nose is volatile and pruney, the color dark, almost Port-like. The wine is very soft and flat. The fruit seems waxy and dead, lightly pruney but also a bit green; it tastes as though half the grapes were underripe and half were raisined.",84,32.0,Merlot
28291,US,"On the sharp and lean side, showing sour red cherry candy, wintergreen and green peppercorn flavors, fattened with sweet oak. Dry and elegant, but not very rich. Drink up.",86,56.0,Pinot Noir
85641,US,"A massive wine that could only have been grown under the California sun. Shows enormously ripe flavors of red and black currants, cola, red plums and spices, enriched with significant oak. Not particularly nuanced or elegant now due to the obvious power. Could age out, but the future is uncertain.",87,48.0,Pinot Noir
55978,US,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, this wine's fruit is sourced entirely from the Conner Lee Vineyard. The superjuicy black-cherry flavor is balanced by generous acidity. Vibrant and full, long and fresh, this could age gracefully for a decade or more.",92,30.0,Meritage
71079,US,"Tastes sweet, with cherry and blackberry jelly flavors, but racy and clean in acidity, like a simple, by-the-glass wine at a fast food restaurant.",82,8.0,Merlot
2450,US,"Rounded aromas of melon and salty peaches rise to the nose on this wine from the Monterey County appellation just south of the Santa Lucia Highlands. The palate is driven by citrus, grass and a rather extreme sense of sea salt, enhanced with mouth-watering acidity and a nectarine flesh finish. It's tasty though varietally uncommon.",88,25.0,Sauvignon Blanc
44353,US,"A pear, apple-orange and earth bouquet sets the stage for a palate chockful of pineapple, pear and lemon flavor. Toast notes offset and vibrant acidity uplifts the fruit nicely. The finish is long and tart-sweet with complex leesy, earthy notes. Medium-bodied and restrained, this complex wine shows depth. Give it six months to a year to unfold.",89,37.0,Chardonnay
93414,US,"A soft, medicinal and uninteresting wine, marked by harshness and green flavors that barely suggest cherries.",80,12.0,Zinfandel
95563,US,"This is sort of a second wine from Reverie. It's rustic and sharp, with tart, jellied blackberry and cherry flavors. Not going anywhere.",83,40.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
55613,US,"A nice, slightly sweet white wine, with tropical fruit, buttered toast, white flower and vanilla flavors. Easy to drink as a cocktail sipper.",86,22.0,Marsanne
88511,US,"Soft and semisweet, with the honeyed, lemon-and-lime Gatorade taste, this everyday white is simple and clean.",83,19.0,Sauvignon Blanc
73014,Italy,"A sophisticated blend of Merlot, Cabernet and Sangioveto from the newly inaugurated Frassinello winery designed by architect Renzo Piano. It has deeply etched oak tones over blueberry and forest berry. The close is fresh and crisp with very good length.",90,45.0,Red Blend
97687,Italy,"Ripe fruit notes of black cherry and raspberry are followed by chocolate and delicate spice. This 80-20 blend of Sangiovese and Merlot from Maremma, Tuscany is sharp and well-focused in the mouth with lingering tones of ripe fruit and a crisp berry finale.",88,25.0,Red Blend
13108,US,"With each bump up in price, the winemaker ups the percentage of new oak; here it's 25%. Half the fruit is estate grown, and this light, clean, well-balanced wine drinks like a village Burgundy, with the right hint of herb around the tart red fruit.",88,18.0,Pinot Noir
67939,Italy,"Ripassá is a wine that has been refermented on the skins to produce extra richness and intensity of aromas. This distinctive wine offers tones of blackberry jam, currant, clove and curry powder. It's a luscious and slightly sweet tasting wine with chewy tannins.",88,18.0,Red Blend
90401,US,"Very ripe and aromatic, throwing out cascades of inviting scents. New toasty oak dominates, with undercurrents of blackberry jam, blueberry, mocha and anise. In the mouth, huge, lush, powerful, an explosively fruity young wine, yet maintains balance and elegance. Really good. Best now–2015.",94,95.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
26120,US,"Rich and toasty, this has aromas barrel-dominated aromas and flavors of vanilla and sweet, buttery oak. The underlying wine is strong in cherry and balsam flavors, which are girded by considerable tannins. Pair this with game meats, stews or barbecue to wrestle the structural elements into submission.",88,40.0,Pinotage
86678,US,"A feminine wine, soft, gentle and delicious in flavor. Feels light and silky in the mouth, with rich notes of cherries, raspberries, cotton candy, buttered cinnamon toast and sandalwood. Almost sweet, but it finishes nice and dry. Drink now–2013.",88,48.0,Pinot Noir
26031,US,"Quilceda's single-vineyard Bordeaux-style blend is 76% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Cabernet Franc, 7% Merlot and 3% Petit Verdot, from a vineyard just across the road from Champoux. Dusty and fragrant, it suggests soft leather, toast, caramel and coconut, hiding its fruit at first in a wash of luxurious barrel flavors. That fruit emerges with some hours of decanting, a tart and racy mix of berry and sweet tomato.",93,85.0,Red Blend
92620,US,"The Cabernet Sauvignon is from vines planted in 1972—fruit that once went into Leonetti Cab. The other half is evenly split between Merlot and Cab Franc, crafting a flavor mix of herb and earth, with moderate density. It's nicely spiced, with brambly red fruits, and some butterscotch coming into the finish.",89,45.0,Red Blend
37331,US,"Some Cabs go into a dip at the age of five, and this may be one of them. It's a little awkward in structure, with a sharpness of feeling, and the oak isn't integrated with the ripe blackberry fruit. Could emerge and be fine in a couple more years.",86,42.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
67812,US,"Showing the rich, exotic side of Viognier, this has ripe, flamboyant flavors of tropical fruit, white flower and spice. It has a controlled dryness and citrusy acidity; this is a lovely, versatile white.",87,24.0,Viognier
55349,US,"A meaty Shiraz that pulls no punches, proudly displaying its black raspberry and earthy, salumi-infused flavors around a rich, dense texture full of leather and a touch of smoke. The Temecula Valley is continuing to make strides and this is a jumbo-jet-sized example that finishes a teensy bit sweet. The Shiraz is blended with 11% Cinsault.",88,56.0,Shiraz
43996,Spain,"Aromas of black fruits, light oak and violets are good but basic, and that pretty much defines the rest of the wine. Expect an easy flowing palate with candied, regular berry flavors in front of a light to medium finish. Nicely done and approachable.",87,15.0,Monastrell
68171,US,"Good color, but the very light cranberry fruit flavors have a strong mint streak running down the core of this wine. It's hard to find varietal character here; it's thin, herbal and a bit hard-edged.",84,25.0,Sangiovese
102530,Italy,"Truckloads of fresh banana emerge from the nose, and are backed by vanilla bean, chalky minerality and some vitamin-like aromas. Somewhat dilute on the palate, but those banana notes put in another strong appearance. Imported by Vias Imports.",85,12.0,Pinot Grigio
72007,US,"The sulfur in my bottle was slow to blow off, and when it did, it revealed a toughly tannic, herbal wine. The tastes range from sage and tobacco to candied Life Saver blackberry and cherry to shriveled currants. Those pesky tannins turn up when you swallow, leaving behind a hard astringency.",83,30.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
22536,US,"Enticing spicy, toasty aromas and robust, dry fruit flavors are matched by very firm, fine-grained tannins in this full-bodied wine. Based on 65% Zinfandel, it has lots to offer, but at this stage an oaky sensation and the astringent mouthfeel indicate that it needs to mellow. Best to drink after 2018.",89,40.0,Red Blend
15083,US,"Broad across the palate, this brings flavors of orange soda and orange candy, with a grainy impression. It's fruit forward, with a quick fade.",85,22.0,Viognier
6399,US,This attractively priced wine has nice acidity and subtle flavors of pear and lemon. A pronounced swaddling in oak reveals itself on the nose and mid-palate. Enjoy it with food on the richer side.,86,15.0,Chardonnay
95859,US,"Young and appealing now for its vibrant, upfront cherry and oak flavors, this supple Cab has a lush, fine array of dusty tannins, as well as fine acidity. It's beautifully balanced, a tremendously fruity wine that's has a classic structure and elegance.",91,60.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
93316,US,"Ripe in blackberry, cherry and coffee flavors, with a sharp, angular mouthfeel due to acids and green tannins, this is a wine you might call rustic.",84,34.0,Cabernet Sauvignon

90294,US,"Here you have more of the stiffer qualities of herb, leaf, earth and stem. Good concentration and length, with a full midpalate. The blend includes 8% Cabernet Franc.",89,25.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
64243,Italy,"This creamy Tuscan Chardonnay shares many characteristics with its distant cousin in California. It shows a decidedly New World style, with aromas of vanilla cream, dried apricot, honey, peach cobbler and crème brûlée. The finish is marked with a spicy toasted-oak intensity.",92,120.0,Chardonnay
83851,US,"A rich, ripe and complex Cabernet, with classic Napa tannic structure. Not quite up there with the winery's higher-priced Dollarhide or Elu bottlings, but showing similar elegance and taste. Brims with blueberry, mocha and cedar flavors that should develop over the next four years.",90,35.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
41493,US,"Lead pencil and hints of gravel come from Red Mountain fruit, with some of the welcome funk and grit in place from the Boushey Vineyard. Lovely aromas suggest violets and white pepper and hints of smoky chocolate. Smooth, tart, tasting of cherry and berry.",89,34.0,Syrah
48600,France,"An interesting Chard that offers quite sweet notes of stewed peaches, orange marmalade and overripe honeydew. Big and a bit clumsy in the mouth, more vibrancy and freshness is needed to keep things in better balance. However, if you like 'em sweeter, this one's for you.",84,12.0,Chardonnay
77725,US,"Basic Chard, if thin, with just enough peaches and cream, vanilla and toast flavors to satisfy.",83,7.0,Chardonnay
82458,US,"A pretty good, everyday Chardonnay that gives consumers the buttered toast and vanilla notes that come from oak, on top of a friendly, pineapple-flavored Chardonnay. A little one-dimensional, but will satisfy lots of wine drinkers.",85,18.0,Chardonnay
78722,Italy,"This bright Sauvignon offers an aromatic medley of stone fruit, papaya, dried hay and fragrant yellow rose. The wine has good structure and a polished, clean finish that would work with fried finger foods or mozzarella bites.",87,19.0,Sauvignon
36722,Italy,"Musella is a producer of very good reputation in the non-Classico zone, with some of Valpolicella's most beautiful vineyards.

Imported by Vintners Estate Direct Importing.",87,14.0,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"

37314,US,"Though labeled Cabernet, it's a full-on, four-grape Bordeaux-style blend. It sports a classic Cabernet nose, dusty, smoky, with cherry tobacco, forest floor and a whiff of barnyard. The fruit remains tart and showing a fair amount of acidity; the tannins stiff and the mouthfeel tight but sensual. Give this one until 2017 to pull itself together.",92,90.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
2742,Italy,"Dark berry, tilled earth and gamey aromas lift out of the glass. The firm palate offers black cherry, chocolate, peppermint and oak alongside tightly packed tannins that leave an astringent finish. Drink after 2018.",89,50.0,Nebbiolo
67397,US,"A bit earthy and dry, with rich blackberry, tobacco and cedar flavors and a cherry-chocolate edge. Nice, firm tannins round out the finish. Drink now.",85,29.0,Merlot
84008,US,"Very lush and ripe in blackberry, cherry, currant and cassis flavors, with an oaky overlay, and there's a minerality toward the end that smacks of the soil. With an acidic jamminess and fierce tannins, the wine feels austere and remote. Give it 6 or 7 years in the cellar to come around.",91,75.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
60838,Italy,"Sengia Rossa is a blend of Corvina, Rondinella, Merlot and other varieties that shows plush, rich concentration and a soft, velvety feel. Aromas here include black cherry, cassis, leather, tobacco and a touch of licorice.",88,20.0,Red Blend
18012,US,"It's easy to like this soft, smooth wine, with its cherry jam, blackberry liqueur, milk chocolate, sweet licorice, pepper and sandalwood flavors. It feels extravagant and seductive in the mouth, making you want another sip. The blend is Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre.",88,40.0,Rhône-style Red Blend
58003,US,"Estimating the ageability of a Pinot Noir can be tricky. This one, with hefty tannins, brisk acidity and loads of fresh primary fruit, seems to be ageworthy. Give it 5-6 years to let the structural elements begin to resolve and for the flavors of blackberry jam, Chinese tea, mushroom and spice to develop secondary characteristics.",94,42.0,Pinot Noir
99568,US,"So good, it makes you want to shout. Possesses the beautifully ripe flavors that are expected of a great vintage, such as blackcurrant, cherry, white chocolate and cassis, with extra edges of smoky caramel and vanilla. The tannins are perfect, soft and easy, but as rich and complex as a Renoir. Differentiates itself from Napa with its softness and accessibility, but as great as anything from across the Mayacamas.",96,50.0,Cabernet Blend
29053,US,"Young, tart and compact, this is still in the primary fruit phase of its development. Clean, impactful and nicely structured, its flavors run from cranberry to raspberry to light cherry, all running deep enough to suggest tucking it away in the cellar for a few more years.",90,55.0,Pinot Noir
47751,Italy,"A slightly copperish hue suggests this wine has been made according to Pinot Grigio tradition (in which the wine sees longer contact with the skins). You'll get aromas of peach, nectarine, and honeysuckle followed by a crisp-clean mouthfeel.",86,18.0,Pinot Grigio
35703,US,"As rich as it is, this is a somewhat generic Cabernet. It's ripe and fruity and oaky, with appealing blackberry, currant and smoky wood flavors, wrapped into firm tannins. With a sweet finish, it's flashy, if not particularly complex or ageworthy.",89,60.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
76104,US,"A lovely, complex and flavorful Cab, but also tannic, giving it a lockdown feeling. There's a rich core of blackberries, black currants, spices and herbs, while new oak gives it a savory smokiness. Better after 2010, and should glide through 2014.",92,42.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
80537,US,"I've found variability in Especial, despite its high price. It shows an artisinal, vintage-driven nature that can be beguiling or rough. The '04 is a bit of both. It's not a smooth, seductive Zin. The tannins are too feral. But it is interesting, with complex blackberry, blueberry, cherry and Asian spice flavors. Try aging, but not too long. You don't want to lose that fresh fruit.",88,36.0,Zinfandel
61972,US,"The current downturn in demand for both grapes and expensive wines only helps A to Z; there is more good fruit to purchase, and plenty of demand at a $12 price point. This new Pinot Gris is fresh and racy, with a mineral-driven acidity underlying the clean fruit, tasting of pears and pear skin.",88,12.0,Pinot Gris
54944,US,"Huge, ripe flavors of blackberry and plum jam, mocha, black currants, anise and cedar mark this wine, grown in the rugged hills of southern Monterey County. It's quite tannic and dry, but doesn't seem to be an ager, so drink up.",88,29.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
1091,US,"Fresh fruit flavors suggest a bowl full of berries and cherries. Crisp acids help to focus the wine, with spot-on varietal flavors and balance. Both elegant and complex, it's a lovely bottle from an under-the-radar producer.",90,40.0,Pinot Noir

80585,US,"Jammy and fresh, with ripe, rich fruit. Apricot, Fig Newton, peach cobbler, crème caramel, honey, vanilla and toast flavors all mingle into a complex, spicy finish. The price of dryness is high alcohol, but the wine never tastes hot.",88,24.0,Roussanne
31992,Italy,"This luminous white wine benefits from added aromatic intensity in the form of creamy lemon zest, almond blossom and stone fruit. There's good density and richness here and the wine ends with generous fresh fruit flavors.",87,15.0,White Blend
26139,Spain,"Heavy and dark in color, this is stalky on the nose, with a compost component that doesn't scream “fresh and ready.” It feels fairly snappy, but it tastes tart and slightly vegetal before finishing with rhubarb flavors.",82,12.0,Trepat
61959,US,"Helped by extra bottle age, this Syrah is the best of the latest releases from Cliff Creek. Balanced and varietal, its spicy berry fruit is highlighted with grapefruity phenolics. Flavors penetrate and stand up well into a medium-long, balanced finish.",88,25.0,Syrah
12269,France,"Ripe but minerally, all flint and crisp fruit along with the richness from the structure and green plum and wood flavors. This blending of fruit from a number of Chablis Premier Cru vineyards shows the rich, ageworthy nature of 2005.",88,29.0,Chardonnay
102800,US,"This is what might be called old-style Washington Cabernet. The fruit is mixed liberally with bell pepper and dill; there is plenty of tannin and a distinctly earthy aroma of the barnyard that carries well into the finish. For some, it will be pleasantly reminiscent of cru Bourgeois Bordeaux.",85,12.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
92077,Italy,"Ribolla Gialla is a naturally creamy, soft variety, but this expression favors tonic soda aromas and tart lemon candy that help shape a racy and zesty impression overall.",85,18.0,Ribolla Gialla

28510,US,"An interesting wine you can call intellectual. Its appeal is as much conceptual as hedonistic. It's the opposite of today's soft, sweet fruit bombs, being bone dry and somewhat austere, showing a tightly knit tannic structure. With an explosive, but controlled, central core of blackberries, it's a cellar candidate. It will be fascinating to try this wine after 2014.",92,65.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
78767,US,"From the winery formerly known as Napa Ridge comes this modestly priced Cab. It's nicely ripe in all kinds of luscious blackberry, cherry and cocoa flavors, and although it's from the hot region of Lodi, somehow it manages to have crisp acidity.",84,10.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
63439,US,"There's something old-fashioned about this wine, in its strong, edgy tannins and rustic mouthfeel. Yet it's high and hot in alcohol, with extracted, jammy cherry and raisin flavors. Doesn't seem to be an ager, so drink now.",85,44.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
91130,France,"An absolute gem from respected Languedoc produer Gérard Bertrand. The aromas draw you in immediately with intense, brooding notes of coffee, black fruit preserves, cocoa and tea leaves. The mouth, like crushed velvet, offers more black plum and blueberry preserve notes while dusty tannins dance in your mouth. Garrigue spice lingers in the finish. Hold until 2010–2013.",92,69.0,Rhône-style Red Blend
5762,US,"An unusually deep color and black-cherry flavors help make this wine concentrated and full bodied. A thick layer of tannins puckers the mouth, but will help the wine pair with a roast or rich risotto. It's made from 76% Grenache and 24% Syrah.",87,36.0,Rhône-style Red Blend
81252,US,"Shows good Syrah character, a rich, spicy, full-bodied wine with luscious flavors of blackberries, black cherries, figs and tangerine zest. There's also a tangy minerality that gives the wine backbone and verve. Shows the promise of this mountainous Lake County appellation.",88,25.0,Syrah
75313,Italy,"Very floral and delicate, this is a wonderful Prosecco Extra Dry with an interesting blend of floral and fruit aromas that come together in a generous, harmonious whole. It's easy and approachable and would pair well with lightly grilled sea bass or fresh water fish.",87,18.0,Prosecco

58425,Spain,"Smoky and meaty smelling to begin with, like a mix of barbecued spare ribs and roasted berries.

38113,Spain,"Jammy berry aromas are fiery and aggressive. In the mouth, this is sticky in feel, with huge, grabbing tannins and blocky ripeness. Chocolate and vanilla drape overripe black-fruit flavors, while the finish is heavy, chewy and tastes like fudge. Drink this forceful, oaky RDD now through 2020.",91,125.0,Tinto Fino

70126,Italy,"Honey, peach, citrus and dried herbs comprise the nose of this simple Pinot Grigio.

26933,US,"This is made from fruit that's sourced mostly from Mercer's Spice Cabinet Vineyard in the Horse Heaven Hills, with some Tablas clone Syrah from the Rattlesnake Hills.

15610,US,"One thing you can depend on concerning Clos du Val's Cabernets is that they're elegant.

35849,France,"Fresh strawberry aromas set the scene for a bright, red berry flavored wine. It has vibrant, vivid acidity and exotic perfumes.

27047,US,"It's a fine wine, full-bodied and dry, with spicy flavors of currants, teriyaki beef, black pepper and cola, with a bracing minerality that grounds the richness. Could be more concentrated, but it's a great value.",87,12.0,Syrah
8805,France,"Fruity, crisp with red-currant and citrus flavors, this is a bright, vivacious wine. There is a tight mineral edge that contrasts with the fruitiness and turns this into a food friendly wine. Drink now.",88,25.0,Rosé
11834,France,"A smooth wine, the tannins suspended within a velvet texture, resulting in an opulent, rich feel. This is very intense, with medicinal and dark plum skin flavors. Powerful, solid, for aging.",91,18.0,Malbec-Merlot
52697,US,"Showing lots more depth and focus than Husch's regular Pinot Noir, this wine comes from nearly 40-year-old grapes grown on the estate. It's charming, light and silky in the mouth, with brilliant acidity framing intense flavors of cherries and spices. Should age well for up to a decade.",92,40.0,Pinot Noir
91278,France,"A richly soft, creamy wine, dominated by flavors of white currants and chives, this is full-bodied and still young. There is enough ripe acidity and full-flavored fruit to see it develop well over five years.",90,50.0,Chardonnay
68420,US,"There's a tight, tannic coarseness to this Petite Sirah that makes it a little bitter and difficult. On the other hand, it's elegantly structured, with a rich core of blackberries. This suggests ageability, it could improve in the bottle.",87,24.0,Petite Sirah
11293,US,"Big, rich and fruity, with fantastically ripe cherry and Dr. Pepper flavors that are elevated by a note of sweet sandalwood, and brightened with crisp acidity. Impresses for sheer power, as well as the long, spicy finish. This is too young to drink now; it needs 5–6 years to mellow.",90,49.0,Pinot Noir
49388,France,"A rustic wine, with definite barnyard flavors. The fruit has some smoky extract, but the tannins and old wood tastes intrude too much.",92,19.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
55434,US,"Heavy on the oak, with overpowering buttered toast and butterscotch flavors. Underneath all that are pineapple and peach flavors. The finish is sweet and heavy.",84,27.0,Chardonnay
44314,US,"A nice, everyday Pinot, with a properly silky texture. The cherry, cola, red licorice and bacon flavors are satisfyingly rich, with elaborate oak overtones. It's a pretty good value in an under-$20 Pinot Noir.",86,18.0,Pinot Noir
43080,Italy,"You'll notice a unique and terroir-driven note of freshly milled white peppercorn that distinguishes this Amarone. In the background are generous tones of berry, black mineral and toasted almond. Pair this extraordinary wine with roasted meat or aged cheese.",94,118.0,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
41102,Italy,"A ripe and rich Barbera d'Asti Superiore with pleasantly inviting aromas of ripe blackberry, Maraschino cherry and exotic spice. All those aromatic layers are washed clean over the palate thanks to the wine's fresh acidity that kicks in on the finish.",88,16.0,Barbera
60978,Italy,"This simple red is a great food wine, and it would pair with just about anything containing meat or cheese. It has heft and determination, with bright accents of cherry, red rose and dried apple.",86,14.0,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
11096,US,"Pinots from this vineyard, which is between the Anderson and Alexander valleys, always seem earthy and tannic in youth, and so it is with this bottling. With oak-inspired cherry, cola, tobacco and spice flavors, it could develop bottle complexity in 4–6 years.",87,42.0,Pinot Noir
74076,France,"The problem with this wine is the wood. There is too much of it, and the toasting is too high, giving a burnt character to the wine. For a 2005, this should be better integrated, and is likely to just dry out.",80,29.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
78777,US,"An oaky, hearty wine that in many ways wants to be Chardonnay. The nose exudes fresh-cut wood, while the flavor profile is all about buttered toast, apple and peach. Stylistically, it's California all the way, yet there's enough acid and natural flavor to help it from being too heavy.",89,28.0,Sauvignon Blanc
4801,Italy,"Bright, round and delicious, this has exotic fruit, white flower and cantaloupe aromas that follow through to the lively palate, along with honeydew melon fruit. It has noteworthy freshness for the vintage.",90,34.0,Sauvignon
41426,US,"From a vineyard called Sweetwater, this Riesling itself is sweet in peach, pineapple and wildflower honey flavors. Brisk Monterey acidity balances, with a tart, prickly mouthfeel.",84,13.0,Riesling
77998,US,"Stimulatingly fresh and clean, this polished SB benefits from crisp acidity provoked by its cool growing region. The flavors are of figs, citrus fruits and nectarines, but they could be a bit more focused.",85,15.0,Sauvignon Blanc
59153,Italy,"Marion makes some of the best Amarone on sale today and this standout expression from the stellar 2004 vintage proves the point. The wine is thick, deliciously succulent and redolent of mature black fruit, spice, leather, chocolate and pipe tobacco.",93,70.0,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
92656,France,"An unusual blend of 80% Clairette and 20% Bourboulenc, this medium-bodied wine is crisp and citrusy, marked by pineapple and hints of underripe peach and pear. It's light enough to be paired with more delicate seafood dishes over the summer months.",86,11.0,Rhône-style White Blend
39951,US,"Thick, ripe, creamy and luscious, this 15.4% Sémillon carries itself with grace and style. The dense fruit flavors mix peaches, apricots, pears and spicy apples; with a hint of caramel and brown sugar. Though quite dry, it has so much fruit as to seem lightly sweet, and the high alcohol does not take away from the complexity. If it were not fermented dry, this would be a stunning late harvest dessert wine.",90,19.0,Sémillon
52319,US,"This vintage marks a big step forward for this Oregon Sauvignon Blanc. As fresh and racy as a bright young Quincy from the Loire, this sappy Sauvignon has the snap of natural acidity and a tongue-tingling mix of melon, lime and grapefruit on the palate. It's drinking beautifully right now while at its most fresh.",90,20.0,Sauvignon Blanc
92779,US,"So much fruit, so much acidity, such a nice PG. It's all about apples, peaches, limes and wildflowers, dry and delicious, and the most remarkable acidity for balance. This lusty wine is versatile with all sorts of different foods.",87,18.0,Pinot Grigio
103618,US,"Apple-cider and earth aromas open to a simple apple-toast palate. The mouthfeel is even, the finish dry and rather woody. Then again, there are few drinkable California Chardonnays of this age.",82,13.0,Chardonnay
44960,US,"Another spectacular effort, though they've bumped up the price significantly. This is beautifully varietal, mixing floral, bath powder, apple and grapefruit components in both the nose and the mouth. There is an elegant intensity that powers the wine through an exceptionally long, brilliant finish; the residual sweetness keeps the alcohol down to 11.5% without making the wine either soft or sugary. 14,500 cases produced.",90,8.0,Gewürztraminer
6184,US,"Fans of Petit Verdot, which has almost attained cult status in Washington, will not want to miss this spectacular effort. Bright, chewy and muscular though it is, the tannins have been polished perfectly, and set off with 40% new oak, adding dark, smoky chocolate and espresso flavors. The acidity keeps up, underscoring tart berry fruit with some sweet green-tomato highlights.",94,30.0,Petit Verdot
83408,US,"A curious wine. It's not tasting at all good now. So tannic, so new oaky, it feels clumsy and astringent and awkward in the mouth. Then you realize how rich the heart of fruit is, offering an enormous array of blackberries, blueberries and black currants. The grapes are from Rutherford. The gamble is if the fruit will outlast the tannins.",91,80.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
33392,US,"An extraordinary wine, dry, crisp in acidity and wonderfully silky in the mouth. The flavors are deep and complex, changing with every second as the wine breathes. Raspberries, wild clove and cinnamon spices, cola, dried herbs, things that taste earthy and minerally and woodsy. Insanely complex and dynamic, this Pinot should age for up to eight years.",95,65.0,Pinot Noir
101408,France,"From the Côte de Rouffach area, this is a wine that's eminently alive. Apricot, nectarine and mango comprise the all-fruit nose and palate. All in all, it's like a peachy parfait. If you dig deep you'll find some of those custard, stone and petrol nuances that give Alsace Rieslings their character.",88,19.0,Riesling
16604,US,"A useful Zin, rich and sweet and savory. Blended for complexity with Syrah and Petite Sirah, it's satisfying in black cherry, red licorice and cola flavors, sprinkled with black pepper and baking spices. Easy to drink with barbecue, burgers and such.",87,12.0,Zinfandel
47123,France,"A ripe, soft, nut- and pear-flavored wine, with fresh acidity. It is smooth, velvet in texture, with some apple juice freshness on the finish.",88,14.0,Chardonnay
95978,France,"A rich, but mineral driven wine, with flavors of quince, citrus and green herbs. This is young but over 2–3 years it will develop into a richer, smoother wine.",88,22.0,Sauvignon Blanc
3737,US,"This low-production Chardonnay shows the oaky, ripe notes. It has strong, forward tropical fruit, peach, lemon and lime flavors, with lots of buttered toast and vanilla bean.A firm minerality adds complexity. Drink up.",88,40.0,Chardonnay
27811,US,"Pretty dark in color and full bodied for a sparkling wine, even one that's majority Pinot Noir. But it's delicious and dry, which surely are prime requisites for any bubbly. Shows ripe, flashy raspberry, strawberry, orange, vanilla, honey, yeast and toast flavors, and the mouthfeel is silky and refined.",90,28.0,Sparkling Blend
76937,US,"I drank this at the end of a long, hot summer day, which is when a cold, crisp white is at its best. What a delicious wine. Bold citrus and apricot flavors, acids so strong they almost fizz and a rich creaminess even though there's no oak.",89,19.0,Sauvignon Blanc
90044,US,"Smells and tastes porty, but dry, with raisiny-chocolaty flavors of blackberries and currants. Drink now.",83,22.0,Malbec
33523,US,"Young and fresh, it has excellent minerality. The fruit is light and lively, leaning toward grapefruit, green apple and a smidge of just-ripe melon. It's a lovely summer sipper, with a few good years of life ahead.",87,16.0,Pinot Gris
52858,US,"With an off-putting orange color, this Rhône-style blend seems sweet, with orange, apricot and vanilla flavors.",82,16.0,Rosé
5510,US,"Crisp strawberry, rose petal, peach flesh and a wet cement aromas show on the nose of this bottling from a winery just behind Cambria. The palate tingles with acidity, delivering ripe nectarine and plum flesh flavors, further enlivened by a touch of sea salt.",90,25.0,Pinot Noir
34786,US,Dark fruits—notably black cherries and figs—come with a chocolaty edge. The citrusy acids keep the wine on point as it slowly fades.,88,35.0,Pinot Noir
27550,France,"This is made using a selection of fruit that's sourced from both banks of the Serein River. It's a properly crisp Chardonnay, and it offers a white fruit flavor and a bright, lively finish.",87,35.0,Chardonnay
64718,Spain,"Quite green and also raisiny, which doesn't really compute seeing that one indicates underripeness and the other overripeness. But throw both together and you get a wine that's not all that pleasing and seems to be striving for equilibrium. Gummy, green and thick-tasting in the mouth. A hard wine to get excited about.",82,18.0,Red Blend
72011,US,"Mountain fruit is the key to understanding this 100% Cab. By that is meant a unique combination of firm, astringent tannins and fabulously concentrated blackberry and currant fruit that absolutely demands aging. It's obvious that the terroir these grapes come from needs an appellation other than Alexander Valley, for there's nothing soft or herbal going on here. Hold until 2010, then should develop through 2014, at least.",93,85.0,Cabernet Sauvignon
67222,Italy,"Hats off to the Zonin family for being among the first to offer a Viognier from southern Tuscany. This shows the thick viscosity that is characteristic of the variety, with floral notes of violets and lemon blossoms. There's a dusty touch of mineral or brimstone on the finish.",88,15.0,Viognier
31482,US,"A beautifully drinkable Merlot. It's softly tannic and quite dry, with a polish of smoky oak that frames deep, ripe flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and exotic spices. Very nice now and for the next 3–4 years.",91,24.0,Merlot
